<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME men choose to live in crowded
cities;&mdash;others are pleased with the peaceful quiet of a country
farm; while some love to roam through wild forests, and make their homes
in the wilderness. The man of whom I shall now speak, was one of this last
class. Perhaps you never heard of <span class="smcap">Daniel Boone</span>,
the Kentucky rifleman. If not, then I have a strange and interesting
story to tell you.</p>

<p>If, when a child was born, we knew that he was to become a remarkable
man, the time and place of his birth would, perhaps, be always
remembered. But as this can not be known, great mistakes are often
made on these points. As to the time when Daniel Boone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
was born, there is no difficulty; but people have fallen into many blunders
about the place. Some have said that he was born in England, before
his parents left that country; others that he came into this world
during the passage of his parents across the Atlantic. One has told us
that he was born in Virginia; another in Maryland; while many have
stated that he was a native of North Carolina. These are all mistakes.
Daniel Boone was born in the year 1746, in Bucks county, in the state
of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>From some cause or other, when the boy was but three years old, his
parents moved from this home, and settled upon the Schuylkill river,
not far from the town of Reading. Here they lived for ten years; and
it was during this time that their son Daniel began to show his
passion for hunting. He was scarcely able to carry a gun, when he was
shooting all the squirrels, rackoons, and even wild-cats (it is said),
that he could find in that region. As he grew older, his courage
increased, and then we find him amusing himself with higher game.
Other lads in the neighborhood were soon taught by him the use of the
rifle, and were then able to join him in his adventures. On one
occasion, they all started out for a hunt, and after amusing
themselves till it was almost dark, were returning homeward, when
suddenly a wild cry was heard in the woods. The boys screamed out,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
"A panther! a panther!" and ran off as fast as they could. Boone stood
firmly, looking around for the animal. It was a panther indeed. His
eye lighted upon him just in the act of springing toward him: in an
instant he levelled his rifle, and shot him through the heart.</p>

<p>But this sort of sport was not enough for him. He seemed resolved to
go away from men, and live in the forests with these animals. One
morning he started off as usual, with his rifle and dog. Night came
on, but Daniel did not return to his home. Another day and night
passed away, and still the boy did not make his appearance. His
parents were now greatly alarmed. The neighbors joined them in making
search for the lad. After wandering about a great while, they at
length saw smoke rising from a cabin in the distance. Upon reaching
it, they found the boy. The floor of the cabin was covered with the
skins of such animals as he had slain, and pieces of meat were
roasting before the fire for his supper. Here, at a distance of three
miles from any settlement, he had built his cabin of sods and
branches, and sheltered himself in the wilderness.</p>
</div>

<p>It was while his father was living on the head-waters of the
Schuylkill, that young Boone received, so far as we know, all his
education. Short indeed were his schoolboy days. It happened that an
Irish schoolmaster strolled into the settlement,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
 and, by the advice of Mr. Boone and other parents, opened a school in
the neighborhood. It was not then as it is now. Good schoolhouses were
not scattered over the land; nor were schoolmasters always able to teach
their pupils. The schoolhouse where the boys of this settlement went
was a log cabin, built in the midst of the woods. The schoolmaster was
a strange man: sometimes good-humored, and then indulging the lads;
sometimes surly and ill-natured, and then beating them severely. It
was his usual custom, after hearing the first lessons of the morning,
to allow the children to be out for a half hour at play, during which
time he strolled off to refresh himself from his labors. He always
walked in the same direction, and the boys thought that after his
return, when they were called in, he was generally more cruel than
ever. They were whipped more severely, and, oftentimes without any
cause. They observed this, but did not know the meaning of it. One
morning young Boone asked that he might go out, and had scarcely left
the schoolroom, when he saw a squirrel running over the trunk of a
fallen tree. True to his nature, he instantly gave chase, until at
last the squirrel darted into a bower of vines and branches. Boone
thrust his hand in, and, to his surprise, laid of hold of a bottle of
whiskey. This was in the direction of his master's morning walks, and
he thought now that he understood the secret of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
much of his ill-nature. He returned to the schoolroom; but when they
were dismissed for that day, he told some of the larger boys of his
discovery. Their plan was soon arranged. Early the next morning a
bottle of whiskey, having tartar emetic in it, was placed in the
bower, and the other bottle thrown away. At the usual hour, the lads
were sent out to play, and the master started on his walk. But their
play was to come afterward: they longed for the master to return. At
length they were called in, and in a little time saw the success of
their experiment. The master began to look pale and sick, yet still
went on with his work. Several boys were called up, one after the
other, to recite lessons, and all whipped soundly, whether right or
wrong. At last young Boone was called out to answer questions in
arithmetic. He came forward with his slate and pencil, and the master
began: "If you subtract six from nine, what remains?" said he. "Three,
sir," said Boone. "Very good," said the master; "now let us come to
fractions. If you take three quarters from a whole number, what
remains?"&mdash;"The whole, sir," answered Boone. "You blockhead!"
cried the master, beating him, "you stupid little fool, how can you
show that?"&mdash;"If I take one bottle of whiskey," said Boone, "and
put in its place another in which I have mixed an emetic, the whole
will remain, if nobody drinks it!" The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Irishman, dreadfully sick, was now doubly enraged. He seized Boone,
and commenced beating him: the children shouted and roared; the
scuffle continued, until Boone knocked the master down upon the floor,
and rushed out of the room. It was a day of freedom now for the lads.
The story soon ran through the neighborhood; Boone was rebuked by his
parents, but the schoolmaster was dismissed, and thus ended the boy's
education.</p>

<p>Thus freed from school, he now returned more ardently than ever to his
favorite pursuit. His dog and rifle were his constant companions, and
day after day he started from home, only to roam through the forests.
Hunting seemed to be the only business of his life; and he was never
so happy as when at night he came home laden with game. He was an
untiring wanderer.</p>

<p>I do not know but that this passion for roaming was in some degree
inherited by Daniel Boone. His father had already had three homes: one
in England, one in Bucks county, and another on the Schuylkill; and he
now thought of removing further. It is said that the passion of Daniel
for hunting was one cause which prompted his father to think of this.
Land was becoming scarce, the neighborhood a little crowded, and game
less abundant; and, to mend matters, he began to cast his eyes around
for a new home. He was not long in choosing one.
He had heard of a rich and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
beautiful country on the banks of the Yadkin river in North
Carolina, and he determined that this should be the next resting-place
for him and his household.</p>

<p>All things were made ready as soon as possible, and the journey
commenced. It was a fine spring morning when the father started for
his new home, with his wife and children, his flocks and herds. Their
journey lay hundreds of miles through a trackless wilderness; yet with
cheerful and fearless hearts they pressed onward. When hungry, they
feasted upon venison and wild turkeys (for Daniel, with his rifle, was
in company); when thirsty, they found cool springs of water to refresh
them by the way; when wearied at night, they laid themselves down and
slept under the wide-spreading branches of the forest. At length they
reached the land they looked for, and the father found it to be all
that he expected. The woods in that region were unbroken; no man
seemed yet to have found them. Land was soon cleared, a cabin built,
and the father in a little time found himself once more happily
settled with his family.</p>

<p>The old man with his other sons went busily to the work of making a
farm. As for Daniel, they knew it was idle to expect his help in such
employment, and therefore left him to roam about with his rifle. This
was a glorious country for the youth; wild woods were all around him,
and the game,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
having not yet learned to fear the crack of the rifle
wandered fearlessly through them. This he thought was, of all places,
the home for him. I hope you will not think that he was the idle and
useless boy of the family, for it was not so. While the farm was
improving, Daniel was supplying the family with provisions. The table
at home was always filled with game, and they had enough and to spare.
Their house became known as a warm-hearted and hospitable abode; for
the wayfaring wanderer, when lost in the woods, was sure to find here
a welcome, a shelter, and an abundance. Then, too, if money was wanted
in the family, the peltries of the animals shot by Daniel supplied it:
so that he was, in a large degree, the supporter of the household. In
this way years rolled onward&mdash;the farm still enlarging and improving,
Daniel still hunting, and the home one of constant peace, happiness,
and plenty.</p>

<p>At length the story of the success and comfort of the family brought
neighbors around them. Different parts of the forests began to be
cleared; smoke was soon seen rising from new cabins; and the sharp
crack of other rifles than Daniel's was sometimes heard in the
morning. This grieved him sadly. Most people would have been pleased
to find neighbors in the loneliness of the woods; but what pleased
others did not please him. They were crowding upon him; they were
driving away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
his game: this was his trouble. But, after all, there
was one good farmer who came into the region and made his settlement;
which settlement, as it turned out, proved a happy thing for Daniel.
This was a very worthy man named Bryan. He cleared his land, built his
cabin upon a sloping hill, not very far from Mr. Boone's, and before a
great while, by dint of industry, had a good farm of more than a
hundred acres. This farm was beautifully situated. A pretty stream of
water almost encircled it. On the banks of the Schuylkill, Daniel
Boone found all his education, such as it was; on the banks of the
Yadkin he found something far better. I must tell you now of a very
strange adventure.</p>

<p>One evening, with another young friend, he started out upon what is
called a "<i>fire-hunt</i>." Perhaps you do not know what this means. I
will explain it to you. Two people are always necessary for a
fire-hunt. One goes before, carrying a blazing torch of pitch-pine
wood (or lightwood, as it is called in the southern country), while
the other follows behind with his rifle. In this way the two hunters
move through the forests. When an animal is startled, he will stand
gazing at the light, and his eyes may be seen shining distinctly: this
is called "<i>shining the eyes</i>." The hunter with the rifle, thus seeing
him, while the other <i>shines</i> him, levels his gun with steady aim, and
has a fair shot.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
This mode of hunting is still practised in many
parts of our country, and is everywhere known as a <i>fire-hunt</i>.</p>

<p>Boone, with his companion, started out upon such a hunt, and very soon
reached the woods skirting the lower end of Mr. Bryan's farm. It seems
they were on horseback, Boone being behind with the rifle. They had
not gone far, when his companion reined up his horse, and two eyes
were seen distinctly shining. Boone levelled his rifle, but something
prevented his firing. The animal darted off. Boone leaped from his
horse, left his companion, and instantly dashed after it. It was too
dark to see plainly, still he pursued; he was close upon its track,
when a fence coming in the way, the animal leaped it with a clear
bound. Boone climbed over as fast as he could with his rifle, but the
game had got ahead. Nothing daunted by this, he pushed on, until he
found himself at last not very far from Mr. Bryan's home. But the
animal was gone. It was a strange chase. He determined to go into Mr
Bryan's house, and tell his adventure. As he drew near, the dogs
raised a loud barking, the master came out, bade him welcome, and
carried him into the house. Mr. Bryan had scarcely introduced him to
his family as "the son of his neighbor Boone," when suddenly the door
of the room was burst open, and in rushed a little lad of seven,
followed by a girl of sixteen years, crying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
out, "O father! father! sister is frightened to death! She went down
to the river, and was chased by a panther!" The hunter and his game
had met. There stood Boone, leaning upon his rifle, and Rebecca Bryan
before him, gasping for breath. From that moment he continued to
pursue it; Farmer Bryan's house became a favorite resort for him; he
loved it as well as the woods. The business was now changed: Rebecca
Bryan completely <i>shined his eyes</i>; and after a time, to the great joy
of themselves and both families, Daniel Boone and Rebecca Bryan were
married. It proved, as you will see, a very happy marriage to both
parties.</p>

<p>Being now a married man, it became Daniel Boone's duty to seek a new
home for himself. In a little time, therefore, he left his wife, and
wandered into the unsettled parts of North Carolina in search of one.
After moving about for some time, he found, upon the head-waters of
the Yadkin, a rich soil, covered with a heavy and once more unbroken
forest. "Here," thought Daniel Boone, "is the resting-place for me;
here Rebecca Bryan and myself may be happy: this shall be our home."
He returned to his wife, and she, with a cheerful heart, joined in all
his plans. With tears in her eyes, she bade farewell to her friends;
yet, with a light spirit, she started off with her husband. A clearing
in the woods was

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
soon made, a log cabin of his own soon built, and a
portion of ground planted. Boone seems now to have thought that he
must do something more than use his rifle. He was to make a home for
his wife and busied himself, accordingly, in enlarging his farm as
fast as he could, and industriously cultivating it. Still, on his
busiest day, he would find a leisure hour to saunter with his gun to
the woods, and was sure never to return without game. His own table
was loaded with it, as when at his father's, and his house, like his
father's, soon became known as a warm and kind shelter for the
wandering traveller. In this industrious and quiet way of farming and
hunting, years were spent, and Daniel Boone was contented and happy.
Several little children were now added to his group; and, with his
wife, his children, and his rifle, for companions, he felt that all
was well.</p>

<p>But his peace was at length disturbed once more. His old troubles
pursued him; men again began to come near. The crash of falling trees
was heard, as the new settlers levelled the forests; huts were seen
springing up all around him; other hunters were roaming through the
woods, and other dogs than his were heard barking. This was more than
he was willing to bear. Happy as he had made his home, he determined
to leave it, and find another in the wilderness, where he could have
that wilderness to himself. For some time he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
at a loss to know
where to go; yet his heart was fixed in the determination to move. The
circumstances which pointed him to his new home, and where that new
home was made, you may learn in the next chapter.

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y young friends all know where the
state of Kentucky is situated. It is hardly necessary for me to say,
that at the time of which I am writing, that region was an unbroken
wilderness.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1754 that a white man first visited the country of
Kentucky. This was James M&#8216;Bride. In company with several others
during that year, he was passing down the Ohio, when he discovered the
mouth of Kentucky river, and made a landing. Near the spot where he
landed, he cut upon a tree the first letters of his name; and these
letters, it is said, could be seen and distinctly read for many years
afterward. With his companions, he wandered through the wilderness;
the country struck them all as being remarkably beautiful. It is not
wonderful, then, that when they returned home, they were filled with
fine stories
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
about the new region. They declared that it was "the
best tract of land in North America, and probably in the world."</p>

<p>In spite of their pleasant stories, however, it was a long time before
any one was disposed to follow in their track. At length, Doctor
Walker, of Virginia, with a number of friends, started upon a western
tour of discovery. Some say that he was in search of the Ohio river
particularly; others that he went merely to collect strange plants and
flowers. Be this as it may, he with his party wandered through
Powell's Valley, and passed the mountains at what is called the
Cumberland Gap. They then crossed the Cumberland river, and roaming on
through the forests, at length, after much fatigue and suffering,
reached the Big Sandy. The country was beautiful, yet they were too
much worn out to go further, and from this point began to return
homeward. They had suffered more than M&#8216;Bride, and therefore their
story was not so bright as his; yet they gave a very pleasant account
of the new country.</p>

<p>No one yet, however, seemed ready to make his home in Kentucky; and
accident at last seems to have thrown one man into that country, whose
story, upon his return, made some anxious to go there. This was John
Finley, a backwoodsman of North Carolina. He was in the habit of
roving about and trading with the Indians. In the year
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
1767, he, with certain companions as fearless as himself, led on from
place to place by the course of trade, wandered far into Kentucky.
Here he remained for some time. It was a very beautiful, yet, as he
learned also, a very dangerous country. No Indian tribe lived there,
but all the tribes roamed over it as a hunting-ground. Upon these
hunts, the fierce and warlike people would often meet and wage their
bloody battles. These fights were so frequent and so awful, that the
region was known by the name of the "Dark and Bloody Ground." In spite
of danger, Finley lived there, until at last the traders and the
Indians began to quarrel, and, for safety's sake, he was forced to run
off. He returned to North Carolina, filled with wonderful stories.
Sights like those on the "Dark and Bloody Ground," were nowhere to be
seen. The land was rich, and covered with trees and flowers; there
were lofty mountains, beautiful valleys, and clear streams, throughout
it. Then he spoke of the strange caves in the mountains; of curious
salt springs; of the footprints of men to be seen distinctly upon the
solid rocks; of the strange figures of huge animals on the sides of
the high cliffs. Game of all sorts was abundant, from the buffalo down
to the partridge. There was no country (he declared) like
<i>Kain-tuck-kee</i>.

<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
His tale was so wonderful, that people could not well help listening
to it.</p>

</div>

<p>Whether John Finley was led there by a knowledge of the man's
character, or whether it was an accident, it so happened, that about a
year after his return, he wandered into the neighborhood of Daniel
Boone's home. It was not long before he fell in with Boone, and
completely charmed him with his stories. Boone had known some sport in
the forests himself, but the adventures of Finley were to him
marvellous. He was so much pleased with the man, that he invited him,
as it was now winter, to come to his house, and make his home there
through the season. The invitation was gladly accepted; and in the
cabin of Boone, again and again was the wild beauty of the "Dark and
Bloody Ground" laid before him. There was no end to Finley's stories
of this region. The wind whistled without, but the fire blazed
cheerfully within; and here they sat, on many a night, almost till
dawn, Finley talking, and Boone listening. The end of all this was,
that they determined, when spring opened, to go to Kentucky. Boone
knew that there were hardships and perils in the way, and Finley had
practically felt them; but what were dangers or difficulties to these
fearless men? The first of May was agreed upon as the day for
starting, and Finley was then again to meet Boone at his house.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not strange that other bold men, who heard Finley's stories,
were seized with the same desire for going west. Indeed, Boone helped
to give them that desire, knowing that a few brave spirits would be of
great service in the new country. He talked, therefore, warmly of the
comforts of a new home in the forest, where there was an abundance of
game, and a complete absence of towns and villages. Accordingly, on
the first of May, 1769, when Finley repaired to Boone's house, he
found four others ready for the adventure: these were John Stewart,
Joseph Holden, James Monay, and William Cool. The people in the
neighborhood, learning what was going on, had likewise gathered to
look with surprise upon these six men. What could prompt men to leave
the comforts of their quiet homes, and wander off into the wilderness?
They surely were crazy. Boone was much beloved as a kind neighbor, and
they mourned most over his madness. Nothing daunted by all this, they
were then ready for a start, and were now on the point of leaving. We
are told that, with tears in his eyes, Daniel Boone kissed his wife
and children; and if the story be true, I love him the more for it.
His spirit was beating for his new hunting-forests; he could face all
the dangers of the "Dark and Bloody Ground," but then it was doubtful
whether he was not parting with his wife and children for ever. At all
events, he was leaving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
them for months, perhaps for years&mdash;he knew
not how long&mdash;and who can wonder that tears stood in his eyes? Each
man shouldered his rifle, shot-bag, powder-horn, and knapsack, and off
they started&mdash;every neighbor straining his eyes after them as far as
he could see, as the men upon whom he was looking for the last time.</p>

<p>For two or three days they saw nothing new, for they were passing over
their old hunting-grounds. After this, they came to a wild and
trackless region, and saw from time to time the lofty ridge of
mountains which separated them from the western country. In two days
more, the provisions with which they had started gave out, and the
first thing to be done was to find a fresh supply. Accordingly they
halted, chose a suitable spot for their camp, and part of them
commenced building it of logs and branches; the others went into the
woods in search of game. It was impossible for such men to starve in
such a region; game was abundant. The hunters returned toward night,
with several deer and wild turkeys. The camp was finished, a bright
fire was burning, and in a little time the venison was dressed,
cooked, and eaten. The supper was scarcely finished, when they saw
dark clouds gathering, and presently they were visited by a tremendous
thunder-storm. The sharp lightning flashed through the woods, and the
rain poured down in torrents; yet, in their camp they fearlessly
sheltered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
 themselves, the branches covering them from the rain. A man
can scarcely be placed during a thunder-storm in a more dangerous
place than a forest: every tree is a mark for the lightning; yet these
men were calm and self-possessed, and were mercifully protected.</p>

<p>The storm having passed over, they made their arrangements for the
night. For safety's sake, two men were to keep a constant watch, while
the others slept; and in this duty of watching, they were to take
turns. About midnight, while Boone and Holden were keeping the watch,
a sharp shrill cry was heard in the woods. They sprang to their feet.
"What noise is that?" said Holden. The sound was familiar to Boone.
"Be still," said he; "it is only a panther; come along with me."
Moving cautiously from the camp, they listened again for the cry. Once
more they heard it. Creeping through the woods in the direction of the
sound, they at length saw through the darkness the wild, glaring eyes
of the animal. Boone levelled his rifle with steady aim, and fired.
With a wild yell the panther fell to the ground, and began to retreat.
Both were satisfied that the ball had struck him, and returned again
to the camp. The crack of the rifle had waked their companions; the
adventure was made known to them, and they went quietly to sleep
again, satisfied that for the rest of the night at least that panther
would not disturb them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was a very busy one. Finding game so plenty in the
neighborhood, they determined to lay in a good supply. Part of them
were therefore out in the woods, hunting, while the rest were in the
camp, smoking, drying, and packing the venison for the journey.
Fatigued with these labors, when night came they gladly laid
themselves down, and, like wearied men, slept soundly.</p>

<p>By the first ray of the morning's light the camp was stirring.
Shouldering their rifles and knapsacks, they started on their way. In
a little time they found a dead panther. Boone declared that this was
his panther; the animal was killed with one ball, and by comparing
that ball with those in his shot-bag, he found they were of the same
size. In two or three days they reached the foot of the mountains, and
began to ascend. Their journey was now rough and wearisome, and they
made slow progress. To any men but these, the mountains might have
proved impassable; but they were bent upon finding the new
hunting-grounds of Kentucky, and nothing could keep them back. After
climbing the hills day after day, they found once more that their
provisions were gone, and were again forced to halt. Their camp was
built on the side of the mountain, and their rifles easily supplied
their wants. The journey was rigorously renewed, and after many days
of further struggling, they at length found themselves on one of the
tops of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Allegany ridge. Here they were, upon Cumberland mountain.
At this place they halted once more, to look down upon the magnificent
prospect which was spread out before them. This was their first view
of the new region, and they felt that it was all that Finley had
described it to be. It was indeed a glorious country. The land was
covered with trees and flowers; there were the rolling hills, and the
beautiful valleys, and the clear sparkling streams, of which he had
spoken.</p>

<p>The prospect was too beautiful to allow them to tarry long: they
panted to be in that country. With more earnest desires than ever,
they commenced descending the mountains. This part of the journey was
comparatively easy. In a few days now they reached the western base of
the hills, and entered a lovely plain. Here, for the first time, the
new hunters saw the finest of western game&mdash;a herd of buffaloes. From
the skirt of the wood at the end of the plain, a countless troop of
these animals came rushing over it. The men were delighted; they had
heard of these noble beasts of the forest, but none of them, except
Finley, had ever seen one. As the mass came tramping toward them, they
stood gazing in astonishment. Finley, who knew that men were sometimes
trampled to death by these moving troops, kept his eye steadily upon
the herd until the foremost was within rifle-shot; he then levelled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
his gun, and the leader fell dead. With a wild bellow the herd parted
on each side of the fallen animal, and went scampering through the
plain. There seemed no end to the number, as they still came rushing
from the wood. The mass appeared closing again in a solid body, when
he seized Holden's rifle, and shot another. Now they were completely
routed; branching off on the two sides of the plain, they went
bellowing and tearing past them. "An amazing country, this!" cried
Boone; "who ever beheld such an abundance?" The camp was once more
soon built, a blazing fire made, and, for the first time in their
lives, five of these men sat down to a supper of buffalo-meat. They
talked of their new country, the quantity of game, and how joyously
they would roam through the huge forests, until the night had worn far
away.</p>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, they packed up such portions of the
animals as they could readily carry, and resumed their march. In a
little time they reached Red river. Here Finley began to feel more at
home, for on this river he had lived. Following the course of the
stream, ere long they came to the place which had been his
trading-post with the Indians. They had been more than a month
reaching this point, and, naturally enough, were wearied. Finley, too,
could no longer guide them; and here, for the present, they
determined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
 to halt again. It was now the seventh day of June.</p>

<p>As this was to be their headquarters for some time, they built at once
a substantial log cabin. They were now fairly in the wilds of
Kentucky; and remembering that the whole region was the
fighting-ground of the wandering Indians, the cabin was built not only
to protect them from the weather, but to answer as a sort of fort
against the savages. This shelter being provided, their whole time now
was given to hunting and exploring the country. Hunting was a pastime
indeed, the game was so abundant. They could look out upon herds of
buffaloes scattered through the canebrakes, browsing upon the leaves
of the cane, or cropping the tall grass; the deer bounded fearlessly
by the very door of their hut, and wild turkeys were to be found
everywhere. Everything was in a state of nature; the animals had not
yet learned to be afraid of man. Of course, they did not suffer with
hunger: provisions of the finest kind were ever in their cabin. But
the buffaloes provided them with more than food. From time to time, as
they needed moccasins for their feet, his skin supplied them; and when
at night they felt the dampness of the weather, his hide was the
blanket in which they wrapped themselves and slept soundly.</p>

<p>The country, as they wandered through it, struck them as beautiful
indeed. There were the lofty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
trees of the forest, with no undergrowth
except the cane, the grass, and the flowers. They seemed to have been
planted by the hand of man at regular distances. Clear streams were
seen winding through lovely meadows, surrounded by the gently-sloping
hills; and the fearless buffalo and deer were their companions every
hour. In their wanderings they came several times to hard and
well-tramped roads. It was by following these that they discovered
many of the salt springs or licks where salt is made even now. The
roads to these were worn thus hard by the buffaloes and other animals
that were in the habit of visiting the springs.</p>

<p>The place of Finley's old trading-post, where their cabin now stood,
seems to have been chosen by him not only as a central point for
trade: it was on the side of a finely-sloping hill, and commanded a
good view of the country below. The situation was beautiful. Perhaps
he chose it when he was a lonely white man in the wilderness, because
thence he might readily see the approach of Indians, and make his
escape, or perhaps it was the very beauty of the spot that charmed
him. He had a love for the beautiful. One day, he and Boone were
standing by the door of the cabin. The wind was sighing in the tops of
the forest, and while they were listening to the music, they were
looking out upon the beautiful region below; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
 grass was green, and
the bright flowers turned up their leaves to the sun. "Glorious
country!" cried Finley; "this wilderness does indeed blossom like the
rose."&mdash;"Yes," replied Boone, "and who would live amid the barren
pine-hills of North Carolina, to hear the screaming of the jay, and
now and then shoot a deer too lean to be eaten? This is the land for
hunters. Here man and beast may grow to their full size."</p>

<p>In this way, for more than six months, these men fearlessly hunted and
roamed through the woods. Contrary to their expectations, through the
whole summer they saw no Indians, nor did they meet with any
remarkable adventure. The precaution of a nightly watch was adopted,
but they met with no disturbance from man or beast. They had glorious
sport by day, and slept quietly at night. After this, as you will see,
they began to meet difficulties.</p>

<p>On the 22d of December, Boone and Stewart started off, as they had
often done before, upon an exploring tour. After wandering several
miles, they pressed their way through a piece of thick woods, and came
out upon a boundless open forest. Here they found quantities of
persimmon-trees, loaded with ripe fruit, while clusters of wild grapes
covered the vines that were hanging from the lofty branches. Flowers
were still in bloom, and scented the air; herds of animals might be
seen through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the forest in every direction: add to this that the day
was beautiful, and you will not be surprised to learn that they
continued to wander&mdash;indeed, that they wandered much further than they
supposed. It was nearly dark when they reached the Kentucky river, and
stood looking upon its rippling waters. Perceiving a hill close by,
they climbed it, that they might take a better view of the course of
the stream. They were now descending, on their way homeward, when
suddenly they heard an Indian yell, and out rushed from the canebrake
a party of savages. They had no time for resistance&mdash;indeed, time was
nothing; they were overpowered by numbers. The savages seized them,
took away their rifles and ammunition, bound them, and marched them
off to their camp. The next morning they started off with their
prisoners, the poor fellows not knowing where they were going, or what
was to be done to them. They did not know one word of their language,
and could therefore learn nothing: this much, however, they very well
understood&mdash;that it would not do to show any signs of fear to the
Indians; and therefore they went on cheerfully. In a little time they
became better acquainted with their captors, and judged, from certain
signs, that the Indians themselves had not determined what was to be
done. Part seemed to be for sparing them, part for killing; still
their cheer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
fulness was the same. This apparent fearlessness deceived
the Indians; they supposed the prisoners were well pleased with their
condition, and did not watch them closely. On the seventh night of
their march, the savages, as usual, made their camp, and all laid down
to sleep. About midnight, Boone touched Stewart, and waked him: now or
never was their time. They rose, groped their way to the rifles, and
stole from the camp. They hardly dared to look behind them; every
sound startled them, even the snapping of the twigs under their feet.
Fortunately, it was dark, even if the Indians pursued. They wandered
all that night and the whole of the next day, when at last, without
meeting a man, they reached their own camp. But what was their
surprise on finding the camp plundered, and not one of their
companions to be seen? What had become of them? Perhaps they were
prisoners; possibly they were murdered; or it might be that they had
started back for North Carolina. They were safe, but where were their
comrades? Wearied in body, and tormented with fears for their friends,
they commenced preparing for the night. A sound was now heard. They
seized their rifles, and stood ready, expecting the Indians. Two men
were seen indistinctly approaching. "Who comes there?" cried Boone.
"White men and friends," was the answer. Boone knew the voice. In an
instant more, his brother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Squire Boone, with another man, entered the
cabin. These two men had set out from Carolina for the purpose of
reaching them, and had for days been wandering in search of their
camp. It was a joyous meeting&mdash;the more joyous, because unexpected.
Big tears were again in Daniel Boone's eyes when he heard, from his
brother, that his wife and children were well.

    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Squire Boone had told his brother
all the news of home, it became his turn to be a listener, while
Daniel talked to him of all that happened since they parted. After
telling him of the beautiful country, and their happy freedom as they
wandered through it for six months, then came the story of his
captivity and escape. That escape was but just now made, and with a
full heart he dwelt upon this part of his story. It would not have
been strange if Squire had now felt alarmed; but his disposition was
much like his brother's: he loved the woods, and was afraid of
nothing.</p>

<p>In a little time, the four were once more hunting freely through the
forests. Signs of Indians were to be seen around, however; possibly
they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
 the very Indians who had captured them. In their wanderings,
therefore, they kept together usually, for self-protection.
One day, they started out upon a buffalo-hunt. As they came upon a
herd of these animals, Stewart lodged his ball in one of them, without
bringing him down. The buffalo went tearing through the forest; and
Daniel Boone, with Stewart, forgetful of everything else, went chasing
after him. Naturally enough, like excited men, they had no idea how
far they had travelled, until their very weariness reminded them that
it was time to turn back. Tired as he was, a harder race was now
before Boone. They had scarcely started on their return, when a party
of Indians rushed from the canebrake, and let fly their arrows.
Stewart fell dead on the spot. Boone would have fired his rifle, but
he felt it was useless: he could kill but one man; his only chance of
escape was in flight. With Indian yells and arrows close behind him,
he leaped forward, and, by tremendous exertions, at last distanced his
pursuers. When he reached the camp, he fell, completely exhausted.</p>

<p>The party, now cut down to three, was in a little time reduced to two.
From some cause or other, they could not tell what&mdash;possibly the sad
story of Stewart's death, and the fear of like troubles&mdash;the companion
who had come out with Squire Boone determined upon returning to North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Carolina. Very soon, therefore, he left them alone in the
wilderness.
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
</p>


<p>It is not strange that, being thus deserted, Squire Boone felt
restless and dissatisfied; the wonder is, that Daniel was not
dissatisfied likewise. But he was happy and contented, and often
struggled to call up the same feelings in his brother. "You see," he
would often say, "how little nature requires, to be satisfied.
Happiness, the companion of content, is rather found in our own
breasts than in the enjoyment of external things. I firmly believe it
requires but a little philosophy to make a man happy in whatsoever
state he is. This consists in a full resignation to the will of
Providence; and a resigned soul finds pleasure in a path strewed with
briars and thorns." This was good counsel, my young friends, and I
hope you will bear it with you through life. It will serve to comfort
you as much as it did Squire Boone.</p>
</div>

<p>To be idle, was to allow time for this melancholy, and Daniel Boone
kept his brother constantly busy. The Indians, they were certain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
knew where their present camp was, and therefore they resolved to
make another. After choosing their spot, they employed themselves
industriously in erecting another cabin, which might serve to shelter
them through the coming winter. This being finished, they went to
their old sport, wandering through the woods, admiring the country,
and bringing down now and then a buffalo or a deer with their rifles.
At night, they would return to their camp, raise a fire, cook their
supper, and sit till long after midnight, talking of their old home on
the Yadkin. Squire forgot his loneliness, and became quite satisfied.
In this way time rolled off until the winter had passed away, and
spring appeared. Strangely enough, they had been undisturbed; they had
met not even with one Indian.</p>

<p>They had learned in the wilderness to dispense well nigh with all
comforts; food and sleep were all they expected. But their powder and
shot were now beginning to run low, and without these they could not
long procure food. It was necessary, therefore, to make some
arrangement whereby they might obtain a fresh supply. Their plan was
soon settled: Squire Boone was to go back to North Carolina, and
return with ammunition. They supposed horses would be valuable, also,
and he was likewise to bring with him two of these. Perilous as the
plan was, Squire agreed to bear his part in it, and Daniel as
cheerfully consented to his. Accordingly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
on the first day of May,
Squire set off for the Yadkin; and, as if nothing was to be wanting to
leave Daniel in perfect loneliness, their only dog followed Squire as
he started.</p>

<p>Here, then, Daniel Boone was left entirely alone. Here he was a sort
of Robinson Crusoe in the wilderness&mdash;with this difference, that
Robinson was shipwrecked, and had no choice; while Boone chose the
wilderness as his home. He was now completely the "man of the
woods"&mdash;far away, hundreds of miles from any white settlement. For the
first time in his life, according to his own confession, he felt
lonely. His mind was filled with the remembrance of his wife and
children, and the thought that he should never see them again. He
knew, however, that sad thoughts, when indulged in, will grow very
rapidly, and therefore dismissed them.</p>

<p>For safety's sake now, he changed his camp every night, that he might
avoid the Indians. Sometimes he slept in the canebrake; sometimes he
laid himself by the side of a stream; sometimes in the caves of the
rocks. By day he was surrounded by his old companions the buffaloes
and deer, and at night was not unfrequently disturbed by the howling
of the wolves. He roamed over many a beautiful tract of country. Now
he would ascend a hill, and look down upon the scene spread like a map
before him; now he would trace some stream
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
 to its source, or,
following the well-tramped roads of the buffaloes, would find some
spring bubbling in the forest. In this way he moved over a large part
of the country. At one time, he struck the Ohio river, and wandered
for days on the banks of that noble stream. It is said, that in his
rambles, he one day stood upon the spot where the city of Louisville
now stands. He learned to love the woods more than ever. Long after
this, he used to declare, that "no crowded city, with all its commerce
and noble buildings, could give him as much pleasure as the beauty of
Kentucky at that time afforded him."</p>

<p>Fortunately, he met no Indians. At one time he came in sight of a
roving party, but managed to escape from them. The mode in which he
escaped will show you his perfect self-possession. He had stopped one
day to rest under the shade of a tree, when suddenly he spied the
party in the distance. This was enough for him. He immediately
commenced his course through the forest, hoping that they had not seen
him, and therefore would not pursue. From time to time he would look
back through the woods; and at length became convinced, to his sorrow,
that if they had not seen him, they had marked his tracks, and were
now on his trail. He pushed on for more than two miles, trying in
various ways to break the trail, and thus put them out; still, as he
looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
back, he could see that they were following him He was puzzled
to know what to do. A happy thought now struck him. He had just passed
the brow of a small hill; the heavy grape-vines were hanging from the
trees all around him. He seized one of these, and, bracing himself
against the tree with his feet, threw himself as far as he could. This
broke the trail, and he now kept directly on from the spot where he
landed, in a different direction. The Indians came up, tracking him as
far as the tree: were then lost, and gave up the chase.</p>

<p>Another adventure is told of him during his lonely wanderings, more
perilous even than this. One day he heard a strange noise in the
woods; he could see nothing, but stood ready with his rifle. Presently
an immense she-bear was seen approaching him. Surrounded by her young
cubs, she was doubly fierce. As she came near, Boone levelled his
rifle and fired. Unfortunately, his steady eye failed this time; the
ball did not strike as he had aimed, and the animal pressed forward,
the more enraged. It was impossible to load again: the bear was upon
him; he had only time to draw his hunting-knife from his belt. The
bear laid her paws on him, and drew him toward her. The rifle in his
left hand was a sort of guard, while with his right he pointed the
knife directly for the heart of the animal. As she grasped him, the
knife entered her body, and she fell dead.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>As the time drew near for the return (as he thought) of his brother,
Boone went back to the old camp where they had lodged together, to
meet him. Here day after day he kept his lookout&mdash;day after day he was
disappointed. He began now to be very sad. He did not doubt his
brother's fidelity; he knew he would not desert him; but there were
many dangers by the way, and perhaps he had perished. Then he thought,
too, of his wife and little ones. If that brother had perished, he
likewise must die without seeing them. Without ammunition to procure
food, or defend himself, what could he do? He must die, there in the
wilderness. His brother had been absent now nearly three months:
surely it was time for his return. Another day of disappointment was
now drawing to a close, as Boone sat, sick at heart, by the door of
his cabin. A sound broke on his ear; he rose and stood listening, with
his hand on the lock of his rifle. It was the tread of horses. The
next moment he saw his brother through the forest leading two horses
heavily laden. Here was abundance of ammunition and other comfort. The
evening of the 27th of July was long after this remembered by Daniel
Boone as one of the most joyous of his life.</p>

<p>A fire was soon made, their supper cooked, and long after midnight
they sat talking. Thousands of questions were asked and answered,
until,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
wearied out, at last they lay down to sleep. The sun was high
in the heavens when they waked in the morning.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Daniel Boone proposed a new plan to his brother. Much
as he loved the woods, he felt that two men could hardly be safe in
the neighborhood of so many Indians. Moreover he longed to see his
family: the stories of Squire had called up fresh recollections in his
heart. The plan therefore was, to select a suitable spot for their
home, then return to Carolina and bring out his family. Squire readily
assented to this; and now they employed themselves for several days in
hunting and laying in a supply of provisions. This being done, they
went to the Cumberland river, and wandered for some time along the
stream without finding a place to please them. Roaming about now, they
found many new streams, to which, as the first discoverers, they gave
names. Anxious as they were to return to the Yadkin, they were in no
such hurry as to neglect making a full survey. The whole winter passed
away before they pleased themselves. At length they came upon the
Kentucky river. Here the lands delighted them. On the banks of this
stream they determined to make their settlement, and now (March, 1771)
turned their faces homeward. As he left the chosen spot, Boone says
that "he felt it was a second paradise, and was resolved, at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
 risk
of his life and fortune, that his family should have a home there."</p>

<p>As they journeyed eastward from the Kentucky river, they occasionally
blazed their pathway (as huntsmen say) that they might find their way
back. It was necessary thus to leave some track through the forest
wilderness, that they might again reach their chosen spot.
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Fortunately they met with no Indians.</p>



<p>We hear of but one adventure on their way homeward. After travelling
quietly several days, they were one morning startled by a noise.
Presently a herd of buffaloes came rushing and tearing through the
forest; they seemed frantic. The cause of all this was soon seen. A
panther, seated upon the back of one of the buffaloes, had plunged his
claws and teeth into him. The blood was streaming down his sides, and
the poor animal, struggling to shake him off, rushed into the midst of
the herd. This frightened the rest, and they went bellowing and
dashing through the woods. Daniel Boone raised his rifle, and sent a
ball through the panther. He fell dead. Not far off they met a pack of
wolves, following as usual in
 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the track of the buffaloes. For the fun
of seeing them scatter, Squire now fired his rifle, and away they
went, scampering in all directions.</p>

<p>In due time they came to the mountains. After trying to ascend in
various places, at length they found a narrow and rugged gap, through
which with great difficulty they made their way. It was, however, the
best pass they could discover, and they blazed their track, that they
might find it again. In a little time now, Daniel Boone was again in
his cabin on the banks of the Yadkin. I need hardly say there was a
joyous meeting; he was once more happy in the bosom of his family. He
had been absent nearly two years.</p>

<p>Amid the joys of home, however, he did not forget his chosen spot in
Kentucky; his heart was filled with the thought that his happy home
might be happier there. As this was to be his final move, it was
necessary to settle all his business on the Yadkin; and as he had
tried the wilderness, he felt that a few trusty companions would be
invaluable in that new region. He commenced, therefore, making what he
thought proper preparations for a return. To beat up such neighbors as
they desired, he and Squire gave glowing accounts of the new country;
the rich lands, the forests, the streams, the flowers, and the game,
were all talked of. They saw only, and consequently spoke only, of the
bright side of the picture.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
But there were numbers of people to talk
of difficulties; these spoke of the folly of the Boones, in thinking
of making such a country their home, and the madness of any man who
should think of following them; the country was wild, and all who
settled there must suffer many privations: then, too (according to
their story), it was afflicted with terrible diseases, and they might
all expect to die there, or, if they escaped the climate, they must
fall into the hands of the fierce and cruel Indians who roamed through
those forests; the place they declared was so dangerous that it was
known, wherever it was known, as "the dark and bloody ground." With
these sad stories floating about continually, it is not wonderful that
the Boones found difficulty in beating up companions, and that more
than two years passed away before they were ready for a start. At the
end of that time they found that, while many were opposed to them, and
others wavering as to what they would do, there were some, prompted by
a spirit of bold adventure, ready to join them. Five families were
willing to go with them to Kentucky.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone now sold his farm, and all things being made ready, on
the 25th of September, 1773, the little company bade farewell to their
friends and started for the west, driving before them their flocks and
their herds. In their route, not a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
 way from the Yadkin, was the
settlement of Powel's valley. The story of their plan had spread
through the neighborhood, and when they reached this spot they were
delighted to find that the people were not so timid as those on the
Yadkin: forty men here joined the party. Now they travelled on in high
spirits; the whole body, old and young, numbering between seventy and
eighty souls.</p>

<p>In a little time they came to the mountains, and found the pathway
blazed by the Boones. In less than a fortnight they passed the first
ridge of the Alleganies, known as "Powel's range," and were now
quietly descending the second, known as "Walden's range," when sorrow
overtook them. They were in a dark and narrow gap, when the wild yell
of Indians broke upon their ears. The savages rushed into the gap
behind them, and let fly their arrows. Six of the party fell dead, a
seventh was wounded. The men rallied around the women and children;
the first discharge of their rifles scattered the savages. But the
mischief was done; the sudden attack of the Indians was like a flash
of lightning; they were seen only for an instant; yet, like the
lightning, they had done their work: there were the dead, and alas!
among them was the oldest son of Daniel Boone.</p>

<p>The party, a little time before so happy, was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
 now in deep sorrow.
What was to be done? The Indians had not only killed their companions,
but their flocks and herds had all fled in fright, and could not be
again gathered together. In dismay, the greater part were for
retreating instantly to the nearest white settlement; this was upon
the Clinch river, forty miles behind them. The Boones begged them to
keep on their way&mdash;not to think of turning back; but it was all to no
purpose; most of them insisted on retreating, and they at length
yielded to the general desire. Accordingly, the dead were decently
buried, and in great sadness they all traced their way back to Clinch
river.</p>

<p>Here Daniel Boone remained with his family eight months. At the end of
that time he was requested by Governor Dunmore, of Virginia, to go to
the falls of the Ohio, to serve as a guide to a party of surveyors who
had been sent there some months before. The western country was now
beginning to attract attention, and the Indians were becoming very
hostile to the whites. Accordingly, on the 6th of June, 1774, he
started (with one man, Michael Stoner), and without any accident
reached the point at which he aimed&mdash;the spot where Louisville now
stands. The service for the surveyors was promptly performed, and they
were enabled to complete their work, while Boone was at liberty to
return to his family.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
It is remarkable that he made this journey on
foot, a distance of eight hundred miles, through a trackless
wilderness, in the short period of sixty-two days.</p>

<p>He was not allowed to remain quiet long; soon after his return, the
Indians northwest of the Ohio, especially the Shawanese, made open war
upon the whites. Governor Dunmore felt bound to protect his
countrymen, and, among other acts for their defence, sent Daniel
Boone, with the title of captain, to take command of three garrisons.
This service was likewise well performed; matters were soon more
quiet, the soldiers were discharged, and Boone was relieved from his
post.</p>

<p>He had not been a wanderer in the woods in vain; his fame had gone
abroad, and his services were in the following spring sought again. A
company of gentlemen in North Carolina&mdash;the principal man of whom was
Colonel Richard Henderson&mdash;were attempting to purchase the lands on
the south side of the Kentucky river, from the Cherokee Indians.
<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
They had agreed to hold a treaty with the Indians, at Wataga, in
March, 1775, to settle the boundaries of their intended purchase, and
they now desired Boone to attend that treaty, and manage their
business. In compliance with their wish, he went to Wataga, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
performed their service so well, that they gave him further
employment. He was now requested to mark out a road from their
settlement, through the wilderness, to Kentucky river. This was a work
of great labor. It was necessary to make many surveys to find the best
route, and when the best was found, it was, much of it, over mountains
and rugged regions. With a number of laborers, he commenced the work.
He met with two attacks from the Indians by the way, in which four of
his men were killed, and five wounded. Undaunted, he pushed resolutely
on, and, in the month of April, reached the Kentucky river. To guard
themselves from the savages, they immediately commenced the building
of a fort at a salt lick, about sixty yards from the south bank of the
stream. The Indians annoyed them from time to time, while they were
thus engaged, but fortunately killed but one man. On the 14th day of
June the fort was finished, and Boone started back for his family on
Clinch river. As an honor to him, the party gave to this first
settlement in the wilderness of Kentucky the name of Boonesborough.</p>

<p>He reached his family without accident, and, as rapidly as he could,
retraced his way with them through the forest. The fort consisted of
several cabins, surrounded by pickets ten feet high, planted firmly in
the ground. In one of these, Daniel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Boone found a shelter for his
family. The long desire of his heart was at last gratified: he had a
home in Kentucky. He was the first settler of that region, and (as he
proudly said) his "wife and daughter the first white women that ever
stood on the banks of Kentucky river."

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was now the season of autumn;
the trees had not yet shed their leaves, and the forests were still
beautiful. Mrs. Boone felt happy as she looked upon her new home.
Winter came, and glided rapidly and joyously away. With their axes and
rifles, the men in the settlement brought in constant and ample
supplies of fuel and game, and around the blazing hearth of Daniel
Boone there was not one in the family who sighed for the old home on
the Yadkin. Boone naturally supposed that a fear of the Indians would
be the principal trouble with his wife; and well she might dread them,
remembering the loss of her son formerly in the pass of the mountains.
Fortunately, however, she did not see an Indian through the season.
But one white man was killed by them during the winter, and he lost
his life by unfortunately wandering away from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the fort unarmed. After this, the other settlers were more prudent;
they never went without the pickets for fuel without taking their
rifles.</p>

<p>When spring opened, they were soon very busy. A small clearing without
the pickets was first made for a garden-spot. Mrs. Boone and her
daughter brought out their stock of garden-seeds, and commenced
cultivating this, while the men went on earnestly in the work of
preparing for their fields. They were calculating that they were
making their homes for life. Day after day the neighborhood resounded
with the crash of falling trees, as these hardy men levelled the
forests. While they were thus engaged, they were made happy by a new
arrival. Colonel Calloway, an old companion of Boone's, led by the
desire of finding his old friend and a new country, came out to the
settlement this spring, and brought with him his two young daughters.
Here, then, were companions for Boone's daughter. The fathers were
happy, and the mother and girls delighted.</p>

<p>Spring had not passed away, however, before they were in sorrow about
these children. When the wild flowers began to bloom in the woods, the
girls were in the habit of strolling around the fort and gathering
them to adorn their humble homes. This was an innocent and pleasant
occupation; it pleased the girls as well as their parents.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
They were only cautioned not to wander far, for fear of the Indians.
This caution, it seems, was forgotten. Near the close of a beautiful
day in July, they were wandering, as usual, and the bright flowers
tempted them to stroll thoughtlessly onward. Indians were in ambush;
they were suddenly surrounded, seized, and hurried away, in spite of
their screams for help. They were carried by their captors to the main
body of the Indian party, some miles distant. Night came, and the
girls did not return; search was made for them, and they were nowhere
to be found. The thought now flashed upon Boone that the children were
prisoners; the Indians had captured them. The parents were well nigh
frantic: possibly the girls were murdered. Boone declared that he
would recover his child, if alive, if he lost his own life in the
effort. The whole settlement was at once roused: every man offered to
start off with the two fathers in search of the children. But Boone
would not have them all; some must remain behind, to protect the
settlement. Of the whole number he chose seven; he and Calloway headed
them; and, in less time than I have been telling the story, laden with
their knapsacks and rifles, they were off in pursuit.</p>

<p>Which way were they to go? It was a long time before they could find a
track of the party. The wily Indians, as usual, had used all their
cunning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
in hiding their footprints and breaking their trail. Covering
their tracks with leaves; walking at right angles occasionally from
the main path; crossing brooks by walking in them for some time, and
leaving them at a point far from where they entered: all this had been
practised, and I presume that the fathers never would have got on the
track if the girls had not been as cunning as their captors. After
wandering about for some time, they came at length to a brook, and
waded along it for a great while in search of footprints. They looked
faithfully far up and down the stream, for they knew the Indian
stratagem. Presently Calloway leaped up for joy. "God bless my child!"
cried he; "they have gone this way." He had picked up a little piece
of riband which one of his daughters had dropped, purposely to mark
the trail. Now they were on the track. Travelling on as rapidly as
they could, from time to time they picked up shreds of handkerchiefs,
or fragments of their dresses, that the girls had scattered by the
way. Before the next day ended, they were still more clearly on the
track. They reached a soft, muddy piece of ground, and found all the
footprints of the party; they were now able to tell the number of the
Indians. The close of the next day brought them still nearer to the
objects of their search. Night had set in; they were still wandering
on, when, upon reaching a small hill,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
they saw a camp-fire in the distance. They were now delighted; this
surely was the party that had captured the girls. Everything was left
to the management of Boone. He brought his men as near the fire as he
dared approach, and sheltered them from observation under the brow of
a hill. Calloway and another man were then selected from the group;
the rest were told that they might go to sleep: they were, however, to
sleep on their arms, ready to start instantly at a given signal.
Calloway was to go with Boone; the other man was stationed on the top
of the hill, to give the alarm, if necessary. The two parents now
crept cautiously onward to a covert of bushes not far from the fire.
Looking through, they saw fifteen or twenty Indians fast asleep in the
camp; but where were the girls? Crawling to another spot, they pushed
the bushes cautiously aside, and, to their great joy, saw in another
camp the daughters sleeping in each other's arms. Two Indians with
their tomahawks guarded this camp. One seemed to be asleep. They crept
gently around in the rear of this. They were afraid to use their
rifles: the report would wake the other camp. Calloway was to stand
ready to shoot the sleeping Indian if he stirred, while Boone was to
creep behind the other, seize, and strangle him. They were then to
hurry off with the children. Unfortunately, they calculated wrong: the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Indianwhom they supposed to be sleeping was wide awake, and, as Boone
drew near, his shadow was seen by this man. He sprang up, and the
woods rang with his yell. The other camp was roused; the Indians came
rushing to this. Boone's first impulse was to use his rifle, but
Calloway's prudence restrained him. Had he fired, it would have been
certain destruction to parents and children. They surrendered
themselves prisoners, pleading earnestly at the same time for their
captive daughters. The Indians bound them with cords, placed guards
over them, and then retired to their camp. The poor girls, roused by
the tumult, now saw their parents in this pitiable condition. Here
they were, likewise made captives, for their love of them.</p>
</div>

<p>There was no more sleep in the Indian camp that night. Till the dawn
of the day they were talking of what should be done to the new
prisoners: some were for burning them at the stake; others objected to
this. Boone and Calloway were to be killed, but they were too brave to
be killed in this way. Some proposed making them run the gauntlet. At
last it was decided (in pity for the girls, it is said) that the
parents should be killed in a more decent and quiet way. They were to
be tomahawked and scalped, and the girls were still to be kept
prisoners. With the morning's light they started out to execute the
sentence. That the poor girls might not see their parents murdered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the men were led off to the woods, and there lashed to two trees. Two
of the savages stood before them with their tomahawks, while the rest
were singing and dancing around them. At length the tomahawks were
lifted to strike them; at that instant the crack of rifles was heard,
and the two Indians fell dead. Another and another report was heard:
others fell, and the rest fled in dismay. Boone's companions had saved
them. All night long they had waited for the signal: none had been
given; they had heard the Indian yell; they feared that they were
taken. They had watched the camp with the greatest anxiety, and now
had delivered them. They were instantly untied; the girls were quickly
released, and in the arms of their parents; and they all started
joyously homeward. Mrs. Boone was delighted to see them. The party had
been so long gone, that she feared her husband and child were alike
lost to her for ever.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that when men found out that a settlement had
been made in Kentucky, others were soon ready to start off for that
fertile region. Accordingly, we find many arriving this year, and
settling themselves in the country. Harrod, Logan, Ray, Wagin, Bowman,
and many other fearless spirits, now threw themselves, like Boone,
into the heart of the wilderness, and made their forts, or stations,
as they were called. These were just like the home of Boone&mdash;nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
more than a few log cabins, surrounded by pickets. Indeed, the country
began now to assume so much importance in the eyes of men, that the
Governor of Virginia thought proper to take some notice of it. When
the legislature met, he recommended that the southwestern part of the
county of Fincastle&mdash;which meant all the large tract of country west
of the Alleganies now known as Kentucky&mdash;should be made into a
separate county, by the name of Kentucky. The legislature thought it
well to follow his advice. The new county was made, and had the
privilege of sending two members to the Virginia legislature.</p>

<p>Nor is it surprising that the Indians began now to be more violent
than ever in their enmity. They had been unwilling before that a white
man should cross their path as they roamed over their hunting-grounds;
but now, when they saw clearings made, and houses built, they felt
that the whites meant to drive them for ever from that region. Their
hatred consequently increased now every hour. Another circumstance at
this time served to rouse them the more against the settlers. If you
will think of the period of which I am speaking (the year 1776),
perhaps you may guess what it was. The colonists of America in that
year, you will remember, declared themselves independent of Great
Britain. In the war which followed (known among us always as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Revolutionary War), England struggled hard to subdue them; nor was she
always choice as to the means which she used for the purpose. She did
not hesitate even to rouse the red men of the forests, and give them
arms to fight the colonists. They were not only turned loose upon them
with their own tomahawks and scalping-knives, but were well supplied
with British rifles and balls. All the new settlements in the land
were troubled with them, and Kentucky had to bear her part of the
sorrow. These Indians would scatter themselves in small parties, and
hang secretly for days and nights around the infant stations. Until
one is acquainted with Indian stratagems, he can hardly tell how
cunning these people are. By day they would hide themselves in the
grass, or behind the stumps of trees, near the pathways to the fields
or springs of water, and it was certain death to the white man who
travelled that way. At night they would creep up to the very gateway
of the pickets, and watch for hours for a white man. If any part of
his person was exposed, he was sure to catch a rifle-ball. It was
impossible to discover them, even when their mischief was done. They
would lie in the grass flat on their bellies for days, almost under
the very palisades. Sometimes an Indian yell would be heard near one
point of the fort, startling all the settlers&mdash;a yell raised only to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
draw them all in one direction, while the Indians did their mischief
in another. In this sneaking mode of warfare, men, women, and
children, were killed in many places; and not unfrequently whole
droves of cattle were cut off.</p>

<p>At length, to the great joy of the settlers, the Indians began to show
themselves more boldly: for anything was better than these secret
ambushes of the savages; an open enemy is not so much to be dreaded as
a secret one. Boonesborough and Harrodsburgh (a settlement made by
James Harrod, a bold adventurer from the banks of the Monongahela)
were now the principal stations. Toward these, new emigrants were from
time to time moving, and against these stations, as being the
strongest, the Indians felt the greatest hatred, and directed their
principal attacks. Early in the spring of 1777, a party was moving
toward Harrodsburgh: fortunately, the Indians attacked them; for,
though two whites were killed, the attack probably saved the
settlement. It was only four miles from the place, and the Indians
were now on their way there. One young man escaped in the midst of the
fight to give the alarm at Harrodsburgh. The station was instantly put
in a state of defence. Ere long, the Indians appeared. A brisk firing
at once commenced on both sides; the savages saw one of their men
fall, and finding that they were not likely to gain any advantage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
soon scattered for the woods. The whites lost one man also, and three
were slightly wounded.</p>

<p>On the 15th of April, a party of one hundred savages appeared boldly
before Boonesborough. Every man of them was armed with his gun, as
well as bow and arrows. Boone, however, was prepared for them, and
gave them a warm reception&mdash;so warm, that they soon gladly retreated.
How many of their men were killed it was impossible to tell, for they
dragged away their dead with them. In the fort one man was killed, and
four were badly wounded.</p>

<p>Their loss this time only served to make them more revengeful. In July
following they again came against Boonesborough, resolved upon
vengeance. They numbered this time more than two hundred. To prevent
any of the white settlements from sending aid to Boonesborough, they
had sent off small parties to molest them, and keep them busy. The
savages now commenced their attack, and for two days a constant firing
was kept up. At last, finding their efforts again idle, they raised a
loud yell, and returned to the forests. The whites could now count
their slain and wounded as they dragged them off: seven were killed,
and numbers wounded, while in the fort only one white man was slain.
In spite of their numbers and their cunning, they did but little harm:
for Boone was never found sleeping; he knew that Indians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
were his neighbors, and he was always ready for them. After this, they
learned to dread him more than ever. He now went by the name of the
"<i>Great Long Knife</i>."</p>

<p>Attacks of this kind were made from time to time openly against the
settlements, but especially against these two principal stations. They
all ended very much in the same way, and it would only weary you if I
should attempt to speak of them. It is enough for you to know that the
whites were always on the lookout, and that Boone was regarded as
their principal leader and protector. We will pass on, therefore, to
something more interesting.</p>

<p>I have already stated that the stations of these settlers were usually
built, for comfort's sake, in the neighborhood of salt licks or
springs; and near such a lick, as you will remember, Boonesborough
stood. The supply of salt, however, was not sufficient; new settlers
were often arriving, and it became necessary to seek a place which
would afford more of that article. Boone was the father of the
settlement, and he undertook to find it. Having selected thirty men as
his companions, on the 1st of January, 1778, he started for the Blue
Licks, on Licking river&mdash;a stream, as you know, emptying itself into
the Ohio opposite where Cincinnati now stands. Upon reaching this
spot, the thirty men were soon very busy in making salt.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Boone, having no taste for the work, sauntered off to employ himself in
shooting game for the company. He had wandered some distance from the
river one day, when suddenly he came upon two Indians armed with
muskets. It was impossible for him to retreat, and the chances were
against him if he stood. His usual coolness did not forsake him; he
instantly jumped behind a tree. As the Indians came within gun-shot,
he exposed himself on the side of the tree: one savage immediately
fired, and Boone dodged the ball. One shot was thus thrown away, and
this was just what he desired. Exposing himself immediately in
precisely the same way, the other musket was discharged by the other
Indian, to as little purpose. He now stepped boldly out; the Indians
were trying hard to load again; he raised his rifle, and one savage
fell dead. He was now on equal terms with the other. Drawing his
hunting-knife, he leaped forward and placed his foot upon the body of
the dead Indian; the other raised his tomahawk to strike but Boone,
with his rifle in his left hand, warded off the blow, while with his
right he plunged his knife into the heart of the savage. His two foes
lay dead before him. If you should ever visit Washington city, you
will see a memorial of this deed. The act is in sculpture, over the
southern door of the rotundo of the capitol.</p>

<p>After this he continued his hunting excursions as usual, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
benefit of his party; but he was not so fortunate the next time he met
with Indians. On the 7th of February, as he was roaming through the
woods, he saw a party of one hundred savages on their way to attack
Boonesborough. His only chance for escape now was to run. He instantly
fled, but the swiftest warriors gave chase, and before a great while
he was overtaken and made a prisoner. He was, of all men, the one whom
they desired to take; they could now gain, as they thought, some
information about Boonesborough. They now carried him back to the Blue
Licks. As they drew near, Boone, knowing that it was idle to resist,
made signs to the salt-makers to surrender themselves. This they did,
and thus the savages soon had in their possession twenty-eight
captives. Fortunately for themselves, three of the men had started
homeward with a supply of salt, and thus escaped.</p>

<p>Now was the time for the savages to have attacked Boonesborough; for,
with the loss of so many men, and Boone their leader, we may readily
suppose that the station might have surrendered. Flushed, however,
with the capture of their prisoners, they seem not to have thought of
it any longer.</p>

<p>The prisoners were marched immediately to Old Chilicothe, the
principal Indian town on the Little Miami, where they arrived on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
18th. There was great rejoicing over them when they reached this old
settlement of the savages, though Boone says they were "treated as
kindly as prisoners could expect." Early in the next month Boone with
ten of his men was marched off to Detroit by forty Indians. Here
Governor Hamilton, the British commander of that post, treated them
with much kindness. The ten men were soon delivered up for a small
ransom. But when the Governor offered them one hundred pounds to give
up Boone, that he might allow him to return home, they refused to part
with him; they looked upon him as too dangerous an enemy to be allowed
to go free upon any terms. Several English gentlemen were moved with
pity when they saw Boone thus a helpless prisoner, and offered to
supply his wants. He thanked them for their feeling, but refused to
receive any aid, stating that he never expected to be able to return
their kindness, and therefore was unwilling to receive it. The truth
was, he was not disposed to receive assistance from the enemies of his
country.</p>

<p>With no other prisoner than Boone, the party now started again for Old
Chilicothe. As they drew near, after a very fatiguing march, Boone
thought he understood why they had refused to part with him. Before
they entered the village, they shaved his head, painted his face, and
dressed him like themselves; they then placed in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
 hands a long
white staff, ornamented with deers' tails. The chief of the party then
raised a yell, and all the warriors from the village answered it, and
soon made their appearance. Four young warriors commenced singing as
they came toward him. The two first, each bearing a calumet, took him
by the arms and marched him to a cabin in the village; here he was to
remain until his fate was made known to him. Of all strange customs of
the Indians (and he had seen many of them), this was the strangest to
him. It is not wonderful that he thought he was now to die.</p>

<p>Yet this was a common custom (it is said) among the Shawanese, who
inhabited this village. Prisoners were often thus carried to some
cabin, and then the Indian living in the cabin decided what should be
done&mdash;whether the prisoner should die, or be adopted into the tribe.
It happened that in this cabin lived an old Indian woman, who had
lately lost a son in battle. She, of course, was to decide Boone's
fate. She looked at him earnestly, admired his noble bearing and
cheerful face, and at length declared that he should live. He should
be her son, she said; he should be to her the son whom she had lost.
The young warriors instantly announced to him his fate, and the fact
was soon proclaimed through the village. Food was brought out and set
before him; and every effort, which Indian love could think of, was
used to make him happy. He was fairly one of the tribe; and the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
woman who was to be his mother was especially delighted.</p>

<p>He was now as free as the rest; his only sorrow was that he had to
live among them. He knew, too, that if he should be caught trying to
make his escape, it would be certain death to him. He pretended,
therefore, to be cheerful and happy; and fortunately his old habits
enabled him to play his part well. Like them, he was a man of the
woods, and as fond of hunting as any of them. They all soon became
attached to him, and treated him with the utmost confidence.</p>

<p>Sometimes large parties would go out to try their skill at their
sports of racing and shooting at a mark. Boone was always with them;
he knew, however, that in trials of this kind the Indians were always
jealous if they were beaten, and therefore he had to act very
prudently. At racing, they could excel him; but at shooting, he was
more than a match for any of them. Still, when the target was set up,
he was always certain to be beaten. If he shot too well, they would be
jealous and angry; if he shot badly, they would hold him in contempt:
and therefore he would manage to make good shots, and yet never be the
successful man. He knew too much of Indians not to conduct himself
properly.</p>

<p>Sometimes they would start out upon hunting parties. Here Boone was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
at home; there was no jealousy when he brought down a buffalo or a
deer with his rifle-ball. He might do his best; they were true hunters
themselves, and were delighted with every successful shot. Returning
to the village, Boone would always visit the Shawanese chief, and
present him a portion of his game. By this kindness and civility he
completely won the heart of the chief, and was not unfrequently
consulted by him on important matters. Thus he passed his time,
joining in all their modes of living; he was beloved by the old woman,
the chief, and all the tribe: and none suspected that he was not
contented and happy.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, a large party was starting from the village for
the salt-licks on the Scioto, to make salt. Boone pretended to be
indifferent whether he went or not. The truth was, however, that he
was very anxious to go, for he thought it would afford a fine
opportunity for him to escape. He seemed so indifferent about the
matter, that the party urged him to accompany them, and off he
started. For ten days most of them were busy making salt, while Boone
and two or three of the best marksmen hunted for the benefit of the
rest. He watched his chance for escape, but none occurred; he was
closely observed, it was impossible for him to attempt it. To his
great sorrow, he was forced to return home with the salt-makers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>They had scarcely got back, when the whole village was summoned to the
council-house, to attend a council of war. Boone, as belonging to one
of the principal families, went to this council. Here he met four
hundred and fifty armed Indians, all gayly painted. One of the oldest
warriors then struck a large drum, and marched with the war-standard
three times round the council-house: this was the sure signal that
they were about to make war upon some enemy. But who was the enemy?
What was Boone's surprise when it was announced that they meant to
attack Boonesborough! He resolved now that he would escape, even at
every hazard, and alarm the settlement. Still his prudence did not
forsake him.</p>

<p>The old warriors at once commenced gathering together a supply of
parched corn, and beating up more recruits for the expedition. All the
new men (Boone among the rest, for he was forced to join them) were
then marched off to the "winter-house" to drink the war-drink. This
was a mixture of water and bitter herbs and roots, and was to be drank
steadily for three days, during which time no man was to eat a morsel.
Even if a deer or buffalo passed by, no man was to kill it; the fast
must be kept. In fact, no man was allowed even to sit down, or rest
himself by leaning against a tree. This was done by the old men to
purify the young warriors, as they said, and to gain the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
favor of the Great Spirit. All this was a common practice with the
tribe before they went to battle; and the more strictly the fast was
kept, the greater (as they supposed) were the chances of success.
During these three days, Boone, like the rest, kept the fast, drank
the war-drink, and did not even leave the "medicine-ground."</p>

<p>The fast being over, they fired their guns, yelled, danced, and sang;
and in the midst of this noise the march commenced. The leading
war-chief, bearing the medicine-bag, or budget (as it was called),
went before; the rest followed in single file. Nothing but shouting
and yelling, and the noise of guns, was heard, as they passed through
the village. When they reached the woods, all the noise ceased; they
were fairly on their march, and that march was to be made after the
Indian fashion, in dead silence. For several days this dead march was
kept up, Boone looking every hour for his chance of escape. At length,
early one morning, a deer dashed by the line. Boone leaped eagerly
after him, and started in pursuit. No sooner was he out of sight of
the Indians, than he pressed for Boonesborough. He knew they would
give chase, and therefore he doubled his track, waded in streams, and
did everything that he could to throw them off his trail. Every sound
startled him; he thought the Indians were behind him. With no food but
roots and berries, and scarcely time to devour these, he pushed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
through swamps and thickets for his old home. Now or never was his
chance for liberty, and as such he used it. At length, after wandering
nearly two hundred miles, on the fourth day he reached Boonesborough
in safety.

        <div style="width: 82px;"  ></div>
    </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE we go on, let me tell you of
some of the curious customs which Boone noticed among the Indians,
during his captivity. He had a fine opportunity for observation, and I
think these strange customs will interest you.</p>

<p>It is not wonderful that Indian men and women are so hardy; they are
trained to it from their youth: and Boone tells us how they are
trained. When a child is only eight years old, this training
commences; he is then made to fast frequently half a day; when he is
twelve, he is made to fast a whole day. During the time of this fast,
the child is left alone, and his face is always blacked. This mode of
hardening them is kept up with girls until they are
fourteen&mdash;with boys until they are eighteen. At length, when a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
boy has reached the age of eighteen, his parents tell him that his
education is completed, and that he is old enough to be a man! His
face is now to be blacked for the last time. He is taken to a solitary
cabin far away from the village; his face is blacked, and then his
father makes to him a speech of this kind: "My son, the Great Spirit
has allowed you to live to see this day. We have all noticed your
conduct since I first began to black your face. All people will
understand whether you have followed your father's advice, and they
will treat you accordingly. You must now remain here until I come
after you." The lad is then left alone. His father then goes off
hunting, as though nothing had happened, and leaves his boy to bear
his hunger as long it is possible for him to starve and live. At
length he prepares a great feast, gathers his friends together, and
then returns. The lad is then brought home, his face is washed in cold
water, his hair is shaved, leaving nothing but the scalp-lock; they
all commence eating, but the food of the lad is placed before him in a
separate dish. This being over, a looking-glass and a bag of paint are
then presented to him. Then they all praise him for his firmness, and
tell him that he is a man. Strange as it may seem, a boy is hardly
ever known to break his fast when he is blacked this way for the last
time. It is looked upon as something base, and they have a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
dread that the Great Spirit will punish them if they are disobedient
to their parents.</p>

<p>Another curious habit which surprised Boone was that of continually
changing names. A white man carries the same name from the cradle to
the grave, but among these people it was very different. Their
principal arms, as you know, are the tomahawk and scalping-knife, and
he who can take the greatest number of scalps is the greatest man.
From time to time, as warriors would return from an attack upon some
enemy, these new names would begin to be known. Each man would count
the number of scalps he had taken, and a certain number entitled him
to a new name, in token of his bravery. It is not wonderful that they
were revengeful, when they were stimulated by this sort of ambition.
Besides this, they believed that he who took the scalp of a brave man
received at once all his courage and other good qualities; and this
made them more eager in their thirst for scalps. In this way, names of
warriors were sometimes changed three or four times in a year.</p>

<p>Marriages in this tribe were conducted very decently. When a young
warrior desired to marry, he assembled all his friends, and named the
woman whom he wished for his wife. His relations then received his
present, and took it to the parents of the young woman. If they were
pleased with the proposal, they would dress the young woman in her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
gayest clothes, and take her, with bundles of presents, to the friends
of the warrior; then, if she pleased, she was to be married. There was
no compulsion in the matter. If she was not satisfied, she had only to
return his present to the young warrior, and this was considered a
refusal.</p>
</div>

<p>Their mode of burying their dead was very much like that of all the
Indians. The dead body was sometimes placed in a pen made of sticks
and covered over with bark; sometimes it was placed in a grave, and
covered first with bark, and then with dirt; and sometimes, especially
in the case of the young, it was placed in a rude coffin, and
suspended from the top of a tree. This last was a common mode of
infant burial, and the mother of the child would often be found, long
after, standing under the tree, and singing songs to her babe.</p>

<p>Boone witnessed, too, the mode in which war-parties start off for war.
The budget, or medicine-bag, is first made up. This bag contains
something belonging to each man of the party&mdash;something usually
representing some animal, such as the skin of a snake, the tail of a
buffalo, the horns of a buck, or the feathers of a bird. It is always
regarded as a very sacred thing. The leader of the party goes before
with this; the rest follow in single file. When they come to a stand,
the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
 budget is laid down in front, and no man may pass it without
permission. To keep their thoughts upon the enterprise in which they
are engaged, no man is allowed to talk of women or his home. At night,
when they encamp, the heart of whatever animal has been killed during
the day is cut into small pieces and then burnt. During the burning no
man is allowed to step across the fire, but must always walk around it
in the direction of the sun. When they spy the enemy, and the attack
is to be made, the war-budget is opened. Each man takes out his
budget, or <i>totem</i>, and fastens it to his body. After the fight, each
man again returns his <i>totem</i> to the leader. They are all again tied
up, and given to the man who has taken the first scalp. He then leads
the party in triumph home.</p>

<p>Boone had not long been a prisoner among them when a successful
war-party returned home and celebrated their victory. When the party
came within a day's march of the village, a messenger was sent in to
tell of their success. An order was instantly issued that every cabin
should be swept clean, and the women as quickly commenced the work.
When they had finished, the cabins were all inspected, to see if they
were in proper order. Next day the party approached the village. They
were all frightfully painted, and each man had a bunch of white
feathers on his head. They were marching in single file, the chief of
the party leading the way, bearing in one hand a branch of cedar,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
laden with the scalps they had taken, and all chanting their war-song.
As they entered the village, the chief led the way to the war-pole
which stood in front of the council-house. In this house the
council-fire was then burning. The waiter, or <i>Etissu</i> of the leader,
then fixed two blocks of wood near the war-pole, and placed upon them
a kind of ark, which was regarded by them as one of their most sacred
things. The chief now ordered that all should sit down. He then
inquired whether his cabin was prepared, and everything made ready,
according to the custom of his fathers. They then rose up and
commenced the war-whoop, as they marched round the war-pole. The ark
was then taken and carried with great solemnity into the
council-house, and here the whole party remained three days and
nights, separate from the rest of the people. Their first business now
was to wash themselves clean, and sprinkle themselves with a mixture
of bitter herbs. While they were thus in the house, all their female
relatives, after having bathed and dressed themselves in their finest
clothes, placed themselves in two lines facing each other on each side
of the door. Here they continued singing a slow monotonous song all
day and night; the song was kept up steadily for one minute, with
intervals of ten minutes of dead silence between. About once in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
three hours the chief would march out at the head of his warriors,
raise the war-whoop, and pass around the war-pole, bearing his branch
of cedar. This was all that was done for the whole three days and
nights. At length the purification was ended, and upon each of their
cabins was placed a twig of the cedar with a fragment of the scalps
fastened to it, to satisfy the ghosts of their departed friends. All
were now quiet as usual, except the leader of the party and his
waiter, who kept up the purification three days and nights longer.
When he had finished, the budget was hung up before his door for
thirty or forty days, and from time to time Indians of the party would
be seen singing and dancing before it. When Boone asked the meaning of
all this strange ceremony, they answered him by a word which he says
meant <i>holy</i>.</p>

<p>As this party had brought in no prisoners, he did not now witness
their horrible mode of torture. Before he left them, however, he saw
enough of their awful cruelty in this way. Sometimes the poor prisoner
would be tied to a stake, a pile of green wood placed around him, fire
applied, and the poor wretch left to his horrible fate, while, amid
shouts and yells, the Indians departed. Sometimes he would be forced
to run the gauntlet between two rows of Indians, each one striking at
him with a club until he fell dead. Others would be fastened between
two stakes, their arms and legs stretched to each of them, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
quickly burnt by a blazing fire. A common mode was to pinion the arms
of the prisoner, and then tie one end of a grape-vine around his neck,
while the other was fastened to the stake. A fire was then kindled,
and the poor wretch would walk the circle; this gave the savages the
comfort of seeing the poor creature literally roasting, while his
agony was prolonged. Perhaps this was the most popular mode, too,
because all the women and children could join in it. They were there,
with their bundles of dry sticks, to keep the fire blazing, and their
long switches, to beat the prisoner. Fearful that their victim might
die too soon, and thus escape their cruelty, the women would knead
cakes of clay and put them on the skull of the poor sufferer, that the
fire might not reach his brain and instantly kill him. As the poor
frantic wretch would run round the circle, they would yell, dance, and
sing, and beat him with their switches, until he fell exhausted. At
other times, a poor prisoner would be tied, and then scalding water
would be poured upon him from time to time till he died. It was
amazing, too, to see how the warriors would sometimes bear these
tortures. Tied to the stake, they would chant their war-songs,
threaten their captors with the awful vengeance of their tribe, boast
of how many of their nation they had scalped and tell their tormentors
how they might increase their torture. In the midst of the fire they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
would stand unflinching, and die without changing a muscle. It was
their glory to die in this way; they felt that they disappointed their
enemies in their last triumph.</p>

<p>While Boone was with them, a noted warrior of one of the western
tribes, with which the Shawanese were at war, was brought in as a
captive. He was at once condemned, stripped, fastened to the stake,
and the fire kindled. After suffering without flinching for a long
time, he laughed at his captors, and told them they did not know how
to make an enemy eat fire. He called for a pipe and tobacco. Excited
by his bravery, they gave it to him. He sat down on the burning coals,
and commenced smoking with the utmost composure; not a muscle of his
countenance moved. Seeing this, one of his captors sprang forward and
cried out that he was a true warrior. Though he had murdered many of
their tribe, yet he should live, if the fire had not spoiled him. The
fire had, however, well nigh done its work. With that, he declared
that he was too brave a man to suffer any longer. He seized a tomahawk
and raised it over the head of the prisoner: still a muscle did not
move. He did not even change his posture. The blow was given, and the
brave warrior fell dead.</p>

<p>While among them, Boone also witnessed the mode in which, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Shawanese make a treaty of peace. The warriors of both tribes between
which the treaty was to be made, met together first, ate and smoked in
a friendly way, and then pledged themselves in a sacred drink called
<i>cussena</i>. The Shawanese then waved large fans, made of eagles' tails,
and danced. The other party, after this, chose six of their finest
young men, painted them with white clay, and adorned their heads with
swans' feathers; their leader was then placed on what was called the
"consecrated seat." After this they all commenced dancing, and singing
their song of peace. They danced first in a bending posture; then
stood upright, still dancing, and bearing in their right hands their
fans, while in their left they carried a calabash, tied to a stick
about a foot long, and with this continually beat their breasts.
During all this, some added to the noise by rattling pebbles in a
gourd. This being over, the peace was concluded. It was an act of
great solemnity, and no warrior was considered as well trained, who
did not know how to join in every part of it.</p>

<p>Many other strange things were seen by Boone among these people, but
these are enough to show you that he was among a strange people, with
habits very unlike his own. It is not wonderful that he sighed to
escape, when he looked upon their horrid tortures. Independently of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
his love for Boonesborough, he did not know but that such tortures
might be his at any moment, when they became excited. Fortunately, as
we have seen, he did escape, and we will now go on with his story.

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Boone reached Boonesborough, the
object he most loved was not to be found. His poor wife, wearied with
waiting for him, and naturally concluding that he was lost to her for
ever, had returned to her friends on the Yadkin. The settlers had
begged her to remain, and offered her every kindness; but her husband
was gone: she was heart-sick, and longed to return to her friends in
Carolina. Disappointed as he was, however, he had no time to waste in
sorrow. The Indians were approaching, and Boonesborough was well nigh
defenceless. Just before his return, a Major Smith had taken charge of
the post, and been busy in strengthening it, but much was still to be
done. Boone's energies were now at work, and in a little time the
station was ready for an attack. A white man now came into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
settlement with news. He had escaped from the Indians. The party from
which Boone had escaped had postponed their attack for three weeks,
and gone back to strengthen themselves. They felt that Boone had
reached home&mdash;the alarm was given, the place fortified&mdash;and
that it was idle to attack it at this time.</p>

<p>Boone determined at once to improve the mean season. With nineteen
men, he started off to surprise the Indians at Paint Creek Town, a
small village on the Scioto. When he came within four miles of the
place, he met a party of the savages on their way to join the large
body marching against Boonesborough. The fight instantly commenced:
one Indian fell dead, several were wounded, and the rest were forced
to retreat; their horses and all their baggage fell into the hands of
Boone. Two men were now sent to reconnoitre the town. They found no
Indians there; they had all left. After setting fire to the village,
they returned, and Boone immediately hurried homeward.</p>

<p>He had scarcely entered the station, and closed the gates, when an
army of four hundred and forty-four Indians, led on by a Frenchman
named Duquesne, appeared before the settlement. They soon sent in a
flag, demanding, in the name of the King of Great Britain, that the
station should instantly surrender. A council was immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
held in the fort. With such a force before them, Smith was in favor of
meeting their proposal; Boone opposed it; the settlers backed him in
this opposition; and he sent back for an answer to the Indians that
the gates should never be opened to them. Presently another flag of
truce was sent in, with a message that they had a letter for Colonel
Boone from Governor Hamilton, of Detroit. Upon hearing this, it was
thought best that Boone and Smith should go out and meet them, and
hear what they had to say.</p>

</div>

<p>Fifty yards from the fort they were met by three chiefs, who received
them very cordially, and led them to the spot where they were to hold
the parley. Here they were seated upon a panther's skin, while the
Indians held branches over their heads to protect them from the sun.
The chiefs then commenced talking in a friendly way, and some of their
warriors now came forward, grounded their arms, and shook hands with
them. Then the letter of General Hamilton was read; he invited them to
surrender and come at once to Detroit where they should be treated
with all kindness. Smith objected to this proposal, declaring that it
was impossible for them, at this time, to move their women and
children; but the Indians had an answer ready: they had brought forty
horses with them, they said, expressly to help them in removing. After
a long and friendly talk, the  white men returned to the fort, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
purpose, as they said, of considering the proposal. They now informed
the settlers that the Indians had no cannon, and advised them never to
think of surrendering. Every man thought the advice good.</p>

<p>The Indians now sent in another flag, and asked what treaty the whites
were ready to make. Boone, who had suspected treachery all the time,
at once sent a reply, that if they wished to make a treaty, the place
for making it, must be within sixty yards of the fort. This displeased
them at first, but at last, they consented. He then stationed some of
his men, with their guns, in one angle of the fort, with orders to
fire if it became necessary, and, with Smith, started out to meet
them. After a long talk with thirty chiefs, terms were agreed upon,
and the treaty was ready to be signed; the chiefs now said that it was
customary with them, on such occasions, for the Indians to shake hands
with every white man who signed the treaty, as a token of the warmest
friendship. Boone and Smith agreed to this, and the shaking of hands
commenced; presently, they found themselves seized in the crowd&mdash;the
Indians were dragging them off; a fire from the fort now levelled the
savages who grasped them; the rest were in confusion, and, in the
confusion, Boone and Smith escaped and rushed into the fort. In the
struggle Boone was wounded, though not dangerously.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
It was a narrow escape for both of them.</p>

<p>There was no more chance for deception now; the Indians were
disappointed, and the whites were provoked at their treachery. A brisk
firing now commenced on both sides; Duquesne harangued the Indians and
urged them on, while the whites shouted from the fort, upbraided them
as treacherous cowards, and defied them. The attack was furious, the
firing was kept up till dark, and many an Indian fell that day before
Boonesborough. The whites, sheltered by their pickets, made easy havoc
among them.</p>

<p>When night came, the exasperated Indians crawled under the pickets and
began to throw burning materials into the fort, hoping to set all on
fire; but in this they were disappointed&mdash;there were ample supplies of
water inside, and the fire was put out as fast as it fell.</p>

<p>The next day the firing was resumed, and day after day it continued,
the Indians failing to make any impression. They were too far from the
fort&mdash;the first day's work had taught them not to come near. At last
they formed a wiser plan for doing mischief. Boonesborough, as you
will remember, was only sixty yards from the river, and they
determined, by the advice of the Frenchman, to let the water in and
force the settlers out. In the night, they commenced the work of
digging a trench under ground, from the river. In the morning Boone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
looked out upon the river, and perceiving that it was muddy, instantly
guessed the cause. He immediately set his men to the work of cutting a
trench inside the fort, to cross the subterranean passage of the
Indians. The savages saw what was doing, for Boone's men were
constantly shovelling dirt over the pickets, but they persevered
earnestly in their design. At last, however, they were forced to stop,
for the dirt caved in as fast as they dug; disappointed in this, they
now summoned the station once more to a treaty. But Boone laughed at
them. "Do you suppose," said he, "we would pretend to treat with such
treacherous wretches? Fire on, you only waste your powder; the gates
shall never be opened to you while there is a man of us living."
Taking his advice, they commenced their firing again; at last, on the
ninth day of the siege, wearied with their fruitless labor, they
killed all the cattle they could find, raised a yell, and departed.
This was a terrible siege for the Indians; it is said that they lost
two hundred men; Boone counted thirty-seven chief warriors; while the
whites, defended by their pickets, had but two killed and four
wounded. You may judge, too, how industrious the savages had been,
when I tell you that the whites who wanted lead, commenced gathering
their balls after they left, and succeeded in picking out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
logs, and from the ground, one hundred and twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>Boone having thus successfully defended his settlement, determined now
to go in search of his wife. Accustomed to travelling through the
woods, he soon made his lonely journey to the Yadkin. They were amazed
as he entered the house of Mr. Bryan, his wife's father. The
appearance of one risen from the grave could not have surprised them
more than that of Boone&mdash;the lost man was among them, and great was
their rejoicing. He now remained here with his family for some time,
and here we will leave him for a little while, to talk of what
happened in Kentucky during his absence.</p>

<p>The Kentuckians, roused by the Indian hostility and treachery,
determined soon after he left to inflict punishment upon them; against
the Shawanese they were most provoked; it was among them that most of
the plots against the whites were formed, and the attack, therefore,
was to be made upon them. An army of one hundred and sixty men was
soon collected, and the command was given to a brave man named Colonel
Bowman; they were to march directly against old Chilicothe, the den of
the savages.</p>

<p>In July of this year (1779), they started and reached the home of the
Indians, without being discovered. At daylight, the fight commenced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and continued till ten o'clock. Bowman's men fought bravely, but the
Indians had every advantage. Knowing all the woods about their
settlement, while one party fought openly, the other, concealed behind
the grass and trees, poured in a deadly fire upon the whites. He was
forced at last to retreat as rapidly as possible to a distance of
thirty miles; but the Indians pursued him here, doing more mischief
than before. The savages fought desperately. His men were falling
around him, and but for Colonel Harrod, every man of them might have
been killed. Seeing the slaughter that was continually increasing, he
mounted a body of horsemen and made a charge upon the enemy; this
broke their ranks, they were thrown into confusion, and Bowman, with
the remnant of his men, was enabled to retreat.</p>

<p>This attack only exasperated the Indians. In the course of the next
summer (after doing much mischief in a smaller way in the meantime),
they gathered together to the number of six hundred, and led on by
Colonel Bird, a British officer, came down upon Riddle's and Martin's
stations, at the forks of Licking river. They had with them six
cannons, and managed their matters so secretly, that the first news of
their approach was given to the settlers by the roar of their guns. Of
course it was of no use to resist; the pickets could not defend them
from cannon-balls; the settlers were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
 forced to surrender. The savages
rushed into the station and instantly killed one man and two women
with their tomahawks; all the others, many of whom were sick, were now
loaded with baggage and forced to march off with the Indians. It was
certain death to any one, old or young, male or female, who became, on
the march, too weak and exhausted to travel farther; they were
instantly killed with the tomahawk.</p>

<p>Flushed with success, the Indians were now more troublesome than ever;
it was impossible for the whites to remain in the country if matters
were to go on in this way. The inhabitants at last threw themselves
upon the protection of Colonel Clarke, who commanded a regiment of
United States soldiers at the falls of the Ohio. At the head of his
men and a large number of volunteers, he marched against Pecaway, one
of the principal towns of the Shawanese; numbers of the savages were
killed, and the town was burnt to ashes. This was a triumph, but it
was a triumph gained by the loss of seventeen of his men.</p>

<p>In 1780, Boone again returned to Boonesborough with his family,
bringing with him also a younger brother. The elder brother (who had
been in Kentucky before, as you will remember) now returned also, and
made his home at a spot not far from the place where the town of
Shelbyville now stands. The settlers were all delighted to see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
 their
old friend Daniel Boone once more among them; they now felt that their
leader was on the ground. Mrs. Boone too felt happy. Though she was
again on "<i>the dark and bloody ground</i>," her husband was with her.</p>

<p>In a little time his services were again especially needed. The want
of salt, their old trouble was upon them, and they looked to Boone to
procure it. Ever ready, he started off with his younger brother to the
Blue Licks, the place of his former trouble; here he was destined to
meet with trouble again. They had made as much salt as they could
carry, and were now returning to Boonesborough with their packs, when
they were suddenly overtaken by a party of savages; the Indians
immediately fired, and Boone's brother fell dead. Daniel Boone turned,
levelled his rifle at the foremost Indian, and brought him down; with
a loud yell the party now rushed toward him. He snatched his brother's
rifle, levelled another, and then ran. The Indians gave chase, but he
managed to keep ahead, and even found time to reload his rifle. He
knew that his only chance for escape was to distance them, and break
his trail. He passed the brow of a hill, jumped into a brook below,
waded in it for some distance, and then struck off at right angles
from his old course. Upon looking back he found, to his sorrow, that
he had not succeeded&mdash;the Indians were still on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
 his track. Presently,
he came to a grape-vine, and tried his old experiment at breaking the
trail. This was to no purpose, he found the savages still following
him. After travelling some distance farther, upon looking round he saw
the cause of his trouble; the Indians had a dog with them, and this
dog, scenting his track, kept them for ever on his course. His rifle
was loaded&mdash;the dog was far ahead of the party&mdash;and Boone
sent a rifle ball through him. He now pushed on, doubling his course
from time to time; the Indians lost track of him, and he reached
Boonesborough in safety.</p>

<p>In spite of the continued annoyance of the Indians, the white
settlements had continued to grow, and there were now so many white
men in the country, that in the fall of this year (1780), Kentucky was
divided into the three counties of Jefferson, Fayette, and Lincoln.
Our friend, Daniel Boone, was appointed to command the militia in his
county, and William Pope, and Benjamin Logan, two brave men, were to
have the command in theirs.</p>

<p>The winter of this year soon set in, and it proved a hard one. The
settlers, however, bore it cheerfully, for they were accustomed to
hardships. Hard as it was, too, it proved mild to the next that
followed. The winter of 1781 was long remembered as "the cold winter"
in Kentucky. To make it harder, the Indians, after doing much mischief
through the summer, had destroyed most of the crops the preceding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
fall, and the settlers had small supplies of food. But the forest was
around them; Boone and Harrod were among them, and these two men found
food enough. Every day they went out in the winter's storms&mdash;every
night they came in laden with deer and buffaloes. The people learned
to live on nothing but meat. Boone and Harrod drove away all thoughts
of starvation. They had, however, this one comfort: the cold weather
kept the Indians at home. They had no disturbances throughout the
winter from them.</p>

<p>When spring opened, however, the savages showed themselves more
furious, if possible, than ever. Their plans of mischief were better
laid; they seemed to have been feeding their revenge fat. Open and
secret war was all around the settlers. It would be idle for me to
attempt to give details of the doings of the savages. Ashton's, Hoy's,
M&#8216;Afee's, Kincheloe's, and Boone's station, near Shelbyville, were all
attacked. Men were shot down in the open fields, or waylaid in every
pathway. The early annals of Kentucky are filled with stories of many
a brave white man at this time. There were Ashton, Holden, Lyn,
Tipton, Chapman, White, Boone, Floyd, Wells, the M&#8216;Afees, M&#8216;Gary,
Randolph, Reynolds, and others, some of whom were killed, and all of
whom had their hard struggles. The history of that spring is only a
story of burnings, captures, and murders, on the part of the savages.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
It was a dark period for the white men; even Boone, with all his vigor
and fearlessness, thought it the darkest period he had known in that
region. The savages seemed bent upon a war of extermination.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with such mischief as they had already done, in the
early part of the summer the savages held a grand council at Old
Chilicothe, to arrange their plans for further destruction. There were
chiefs there from the Cherokees, Wyandots, Tawas, Pottawattomies, and
most of the tribes bordering on the lakes. Two notorious white
villains&mdash;whose names will never be forgotten in Kentucky&mdash;were
there also, to aid them with their counsels. These were Girty and
M&#8216;Kee, infamous men, who lived among the Indians, and lived only
by murdering their own countrymen. Their plan was soon settled.
Bryant's station, near Lexington, was known to be a strong post, and
this was to be attacked. This station had within it forty cabins, and
here it was thought they might make the greatest slaughter. The
warriors were to gather as rapidly as possible for the enterprise.</p>

<p>In a little time, five hundred of them rallied at Girty's cabin, ready
for their departure. The white rascal then made a speech to them. He
told them that "Kentucky was a beautiful hunting-ground, filled with
deer and buffaloes, for their comfort; the white men had come to drive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
them away; the ground was now red with the blood of the red men that
had been slain. But vengeance they would have&mdash;now, before the whites
were yet fastened in the country, they would strike a blow, and drive
them off for ever." Then he talked of the plan before them. He advised
them to descend the Miami in their canoes, cross the Ohio, ascend the
Licking, and then they might paddle their boats almost to the station.
His speech was answered by a loud yell from the Indians, and they all
started off for their boats&mdash;Simon Girty, with his ruffled shirt and
soldier coat, marching at their head.</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th of August, they arrived before the station.
In the morning, as the gates were opened, the men were fired at by the
savages, and this was the first news to the whites of the approach of
the enemy. It was fortunate that they had shown themselves thus early:
in two hours more, most of the men were to have started off to aid a
distant feeble station. As soon as the whites found they were
besieged, they managed to send off the news to Lexington.</p>

<p>The Indians now, as usual, commenced their stratagems. The large body
concealed themselves in the grass near the pathway to the spring,
while one hundred went round and attacked the southeast angle of the
station. Their hope was to draw the whites all to that quarter, while
they forced an entrance on the other side. But the white men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
understood this sort of cunning; they had lived among the Indians too
long to be caught by such tricks: instead of noticing the attack, they
went on quietly with the work of repairing and strengthening their
palisades.</p>

<p>But water, one of the necessaries of life, was soon wanting. The
whites, as they looked at the tall grass and weeds near the spring,
felt that Indians were lurking there. The women now came forward and
insisted upon it that they would go and bring water. "What if they do
shoot us?" they said; "it is better to lose a woman than a man at such
a time." With that, they started out, and, strange to tell, went back
and forth, bringing supplies of water, without any difficulty. Some of
the young men now went out upon the same purpose. They had scarcely
left the station, when they were fired upon. Fortunately, the Indians
were too far to do any mischief; the men retreated rapidly within the
palisades. The Indians, finding their stratagem fruitless, now rushed
forward, and commenced a tremendous attack. The whites received them
with a steady fire, and many of them fell. Enraged the more, they now
discharged their burning arrows into the roofs of the houses; some of
the cabins were burnt, but an east wind was blowing at the time, and
that saved the station.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
</p>

<p>The enemy now fell back into the grass. They had found out, in some
way, that help was expected from Lexington, and they were preparing to
cut it off. In a little time, all was still. Presently sixteen
horsemen, followed by thirty-one foot-soldiers, were seen coming;
these were the men from Lexington. Thinking only of the distress of
their friends, they were hurrying along, when the Indians opened a
fire upon them. The horsemen galloped off in a cloud of dust, and
reached the station in safety. The soldiers on foot, in their effort
to escape, plunged into the cornfields on either side of the road,
only to meet the enemy. A desperate fight commenced on both sides: two
soldiers were killed; the rest&mdash;four of them having dangerous
wounds&mdash;reached the pickets. The exasperated Indians, disappointed at
the escape of this party, now wreaked their vengeance by killing all
the cattle they could find.</p>

<p>Finding all their efforts to enter the station idle, Simon Girty now
came near enough to be heard, mounted a stump, and holding in his hand
a flag of truce, began to talk. "Surrender promptly," cried Simon; "if
you surrender promptly, no blood shall be shed; but if you will not
surrender, then know that our cannons and reinforcements are coming.
We will batter down your pickets as we did at Riddle's and Martin's;
every man of you shall be slain; two are dead already four are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
wounded; every man shall die." This language was so insolent, that
some of the settlers cried out, "Shoot the rascal!" No man, however,
lifted his rifle; the flag of truce protected him. "I am under a flag
of truce," cried Simon; "do you know who it is that speaks to you?"</p>

<p>Upon this, a young man named Reynolds leaped up and cried out, "Know
you! know you! yes, we know you well. Know Simon Girty! yes: he is the
renegado, cowardly villain, who loves to murder women and children,
especially those of his own people. Know Simon Girty! yes: his father
must have been a panther, and his mother a wolf. I have a worthless
dog that kills lambs: instead of shooting him, I have named him Simon
Girty. You expect reinforcements and cannon, do you? Cowardly wretches
like you, that make war upon women and children, would not dare to
touch them off, if you had them. We expect reinforcements, too, and in
numbers to give a short account of the murdering cowards that follow
you. Even if you could batter down our pickets, I, for one, hold your
people in too much contempt to shoot rifles at them. I would not waste
powder and ball upon you. Should you even enter our fort, I am ready
for you; I have roasted a number of hickory switches, with which we
mean to whip you and your naked cut-throats out of the country!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Simon was now furious; cursing and swearing, he went back to his
friends, amid the loud laughs and jeers of the whites. In a little
time, the firing was renewed; it was all to no purpose: no white man
suffered, and every Indian who came within gun-shot of the fort was
sure to fall. In the course of the night the whole party sneaked off,
and their tracks indicated that they had started for the Blue Licks.
They left behind them thirty of their number slain.

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>OLONEL TODD, of Lexington, instantly
despatched news of this attack on Bryant's station, to Colonel Boone,
at Boonesborough, and Colonel Trigg, near Harrodsburgh. In a little
time, one hundred and seventy-six men were collected under these three
officers, to march in pursuit. Majors M&#8216;Gary and Harland now
joined them, determined that they would have a part in the punishment
of the savages. It was known, too, that Colonel Logan was collecting a
force, and a council of officers was at once held, to determine
whether they should march on, or wait for him. They were all so eager
to be off, that it was thought best to march immediately. The march
was therefore commenced forthwith.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>Following on in the trail of the Indians, they had not gone far, when
Boone saw enough to convince him that the Indians would not only be
willing, but glad to meet them. No effort had been made to conceal
their trail; the trees were even marked on their pathway, that the
whites might follow on; and they had tried to conceal their numbers,
by treading in each other's footsteps. He called the attention of his
companions to this, but still they proceeded onward.</p>

<p>They saw no Indians until they came to the Licking river, not far from
the Blue Licks. A party was now seen on the other side of the stream,
leisurely crossing a hill. A council was at once held, and the
officers all turned to Boone for advice. His advice was given frankly:
he was for waiting till Logan should arrive with his men. The Indian
party, he felt assured, was at the least from four to five hundred
strong, and the unconcerned mode in which the Indians crossed the hill
showed that the main body was near, and their design was to draw them
over the river. Moreover, he was acquainted with all that region of
the country. After they crossed the ford, they would come upon deep
ravines not far from the bank, where, no doubt, the Indians were in
ambush. If, however, they were determined not to wait for Logan, he
advised that the country might at least be reconnoitred before the
attack was made. A part of the men, he thought, might cross the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
stream, and move up cautiously on the other side, while the remainder
would stand where they were, ready to assist them at the first alarm.
Todd and Trigg thought the advice good, and were disposed to heed it;
but, just at this moment, Major  M&#8216;Gary, more hot-headed than wise,
spurred his horse into the water, gave the Kentucky war-whoop, and
cried out, "All those that are not cowards will follow me; I will show
them where the Indians are." The men were roused by this show of
bravery, and they all crossed the ford.</p>

<p>The banks were steep on the other side, and many of them now
dismounted, tied their horses, and commenced marching on foot.  M&#8216;Gary
and Harland led the way. They had not proceeded far when they came to
one of the ravines. It was just as Boone had supposed; the savages
were in ambush. A deadly fire was now poured in upon the whites; the
men staggered and fell in every direction. The fire was returned, but
to little purpose, for the enemy was completely concealed; a retreat
was all that was left. The whites hurried back toward the river; the
Indians pursued; and now commenced the slaughter with the tomahawk.
The ford was narrow, and multitudes were slaughtered there. Some were
trying to get to their horses; others, more fortunate, were mounted
and flying; and some were plunging into the stream. In the midst of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
all this confusion, the Indians were doing their work of destruction.</p>

</div>

<p>A man by the name of Netherland (who had been laughed at for his
cowardice) had never dismounted his horse, and was the first to reach
the opposite shore. In a little time, some of his comrades were around
him. He now turned, and, looking back, saw the massacre that was going
on. This was more than he could bear. "Halt! fire on the Indians,"
cried he; "protect the men in the river." With this, the men wheeled,
fired, and rescued several poor fellows in the stream, over whom the
tomahawk was lifted.</p>

<p>Reynolds, the man who answered Girty's insolence, made a narrow
escape. Finding, in the retreat, one of the officers wounded, he gave
him his horse, and was soon after taken by three Indians. They were
now over him, ready to despatch him, when two retreating white men
rushed by. Two of the savages started in pursuit; the third stooped
for an instant to tie his moccasin, when Reynolds sprang away from him
and escaped.</p>

<p>This was a terrible battle for the white men. More than sixty of their
number were slain, and among them were most of their officers:
Colonels Todd and Trigg, Majors Harland and Bulger, Captains Gordon
and M&#8216;Bride, and a son of Colonel Boone, were all among the dead.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Those who had regained the other shore, not having strength to rally,
started homeward in great sadness. On their way they met Colonel
Logan. He had gone to Bryant's station with his five hundred men, and
was greatly disappointed when he found they had all started without
him; he pushed on, however, as rapidly as he could, hoping to overtake
them before they made their attack on the savages. The sad story of
the defeat was soon told. All that remained to be done now was to go
back, and, if possible, bury the dead. Upon this sad business Logan
continued his march. Upon reaching the ground, the spectacle was
awful: the dead bodies were strewn over it just as they had fallen,
the heat was intense, and birds of prey were feeding upon the
carcasses. The bodies were so mangled and changed, that no man could
be distinguished; friends could not recognise their nearest relatives.
The dead were buried as rapidly as possible, and Logan left the scene
in great sorrow.</p>

<p>Nor was this all the carnage. The Indians, after the defeat, had
scattered, and it was soon found that on their way homeward they had
swept through several settlements, carrying destruction before them.
Emboldened by their triumph, no man could tell what they might next
attempt.</p>

<p>It was no time for the whites to be idle. They soon rallied in large
numbers at Fort Washington, the present site of the city of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Cincinnati. General Clarke was at once made commander-in-chief, and
Colonel Logan was placed next under him in command. Clarke immediately
started with a thousand men to attack the Indian towns on the Miami.
On his way he came upon the cabin of Simon Girty; it was fortunate for
Simon that a straggling Indian spied Clarke's men coming, in time to
let him escape. The news was now spread everywhere that an army of
white men was coming from Kentucky. The consequence was, that as
Clarke approached the towns, he found them all deserted; the Indians
had fled to the woods. His march, however, was not made for nothing.
The towns of Old and New Chilicothe, Pecaway, and Wills' Town, were
all reduced to ashes. One old Indian warrior was surprised, and
surrendered himself a prisoner. This man, to the great sorrow of
General Clarke, was afterward murdered by one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this punishment, Indian massacres still went on.
Stories of savage butchery were heard of everywhere; every station
that they dared approach felt their fury, and the poor settler who had
built his cabin away from any station was sure to be visited.</p>

<p>General Clarke started out again, against the Indians on the Wabash.
Unfortunately, his expedition failed this time, for the want of
provisions for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
 his men. Another expedition of Colonel Logan, against
the Shawanese Indians, was more successful. He surprised one of their
towns, killed many of their warriors, and took many prisoners.</p>

<p>The war had now become so serious, that in the fall of 1785 the
General Government invited all the lake and Ohio tribes of Indians to
meet at the mouth of the Great Miami. It was hoped that in this way
matters might be settled peaceably. But many of the tribes were
insolent and ill-natured; they refused to come in, giving as an excuse
that the Kentuckians were for ever molesting them. Emboldened by the
very invitation, they continued the warfare more vigorously than ever.
They not only assaulted the settlements already made, but made an
attempt to guard the Ohio river, to prevent any further settlers from
reaching the country in that direction. Small parties placed
themselves at different points on the river, from Pittsburgh to
Louisville, where they laid in ambush and fired upon every boat that
passed. Sometimes they would make false signals, decoy the boat
ashore, and murder the whole crew. They even went so far at last as to
arm and man the boats they had taken, and cruise up and down the
river.</p>

<p>I must tell you of a very bold defence made on the Ohio about this
time by a Captain Hubbel, who was bringing a party of emigrants from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Vermont. His party was in two boats, and consisted in all of twenty.
As Hubbel came down the river, he fell in with other boats, was told
of the Indian stratagems, and advised to be careful. Indeed, the
inmates of some of the boats begged that he would continue in their
company, and thus they would be able to meet the Indians better if
they should be attacked; the stronger the party, the better, in such a
condition. But Hubbel refused to do this, and proceeded onward. He had
not gone far, when a man on the shore began to make signs of distress,
and begged that the boat might come and take him off. Hubbel knew well
enough that this was an Indian disguised as a white man, and therefore
took no notice of him. In a little time, a party of savages pushed off
in their boats, and attacked him fiercely. The fight was hot on both
sides. The savages tried to board Hubbel's boat, but the fire was too
hot for this. Hubbel received two severe wounds, and had the lock of
his gun shot off by an Indian; still he fought, touching off his
broken gun from time to time with a firebrand. The Indians found the
struggle too hard, and were glad to paddle off. Presently they
returned, and attacked the other boat; this they seized almost without
an effort, killed the captain and a boy, and took all the women as
prisoners to their own boats. Now they came once more against Hubbel,
and cunningly placed the women on the sides of their boats as a sort
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
of bulwark. But this did not stop Hubbel: he saw that his balls must
strike the women; but it was better that they should be killed now,
rather than suffer a death of torture from the savages, and the fire
was at once opened upon them again. They were soon driven off once
more. In the course of the action, however, Hubbel's boat drifted near
the shore, and five hundred savages renewed the fire upon them. One of
the emigrants, more imprudent than the rest, seeing a fine chance for
a shot, raised his head to take aim, and was instantly killed by a
ball. The boat drifted along, and at length reached deep water again.
It was then found, that of the nine men on board, two only had escaped
unhurt; two were killed, and two mortally wounded. A remarkable lad on
board showed great courage. He now asked his friends to extract a ball
that had lodged in the skin of his forehead; and when this was done,
he begged that they would take out a piece of bone that had been
fractured in his elbow by another ball. His poor frightened mother,
seeing his suffering, asked him why he had not complained before; to
which the little fellow replied that he had been too busy, and,
besides that, the captain had told them all to make no noise.</p>

<p>It was idle to attempt now to settle matters peaceably. The general
government had tried that and the plan had failed. The war was now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
to be carried on to a close, come what might. An expedition was
accordingly planned, against all the tribes northwest of the Ohio. The
Indians were to be brought out, if possible to a general fight; or, if
that could not be done, all their towns and cabins on the Scioto and
Wabash, were to be destroyed. General Harmar was appointed commander
of the main expedition, and Major Hamtranck was to aid him with a
smaller party.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1791, Harmar started from Fort Washington with three
hundred and twenty men. In a little time he was joined by the Kentucky
and Pennsylvania militia, so that his whole force now amounted to
fourteen hundred and fifty-three men. Colonel Hardin, who commanded
the Kentucky militia, was now sent ahead with six hundred men,
principally militia, to reconnoitre the country. Upon reaching the
Indian settlements, the savages set fire to their houses and fled; to
overtake them, he pushed on with two hundred of his men. A party of
Indians met and attacked them. The cowardly militia ran off, leaving
their brave companions to be slaughtered. It was a brave struggle, but
almost all were cut down; only seven managed to escape and join the
main army.</p>

<p>Harmar felt deeply mortified. He commenced forthwith his return to
Fort Washington, but determined that, on the way, he would wipe off
this disgrace from his army. Upon coming near Chilicothe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
he accordingly halted, and in the night despatched Colonel Hardin once
more ahead, with orders to find the enemy and draw them into an
engagement. About daybreak, Hardin came upon them, and the battle
commenced. It was a desperate fight on both sides. Some of the militia
acted badly again, but the officers behaved nobly. The victory was
claimed on both sides, but I think the Indians had the best of it.
Three gallant officers, Fontaine, Willys, and Frothingham, were slain,
together with fifty regulars and one hundred militia.</p>

<p>Harmar now moved on to Fort Washington. So much was said about his
miserable campaign, that he requested that he might be tried by a
court-martial. Accordingly he was tried and honorably acquitted.</p>

<p>A new army was soon raised, and the command was now given to
Major-General Arthur St. Clair. His plan was to destroy the Indian
settlements between the Miamies, drive the savages from that region,
and establish a chain of military posts there, which should for ever
keep them out of the country. All having rallied at Fort Washington,
he started off in the direction of the Miami towns. It was a hard
march, for he was forced to cut his roads as he passed along. Upon
arriving near the Indian country, he built forts Hamilton and
Jefferson and garrisoned them. This left him nearly two thousand men
to proceed with. In a little time some of the worthless militia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
deserted. This was a bad example to the rest, and St. Clair instantly
sent Major Hamtranck, with a regiment, in pursuit of them, while he
continued his march. When he arrived within fifteen miles of the Miami
villages he halted and encamped; he was soon after joined by Major
Hamtranck, and St. Clair proposed now immediately to march against the
enemy.</p>

<p>But the enemy had already got news of them, and had made ready. They
were determined to have the first blow themselves. At daybreak the
next morning, the savages attacked the militia and drove them back in
confusion. These broke through the regulars, forcing their way into
the camp, the Indians pressing hard on their heels. The officers tried
to restore order, but to no purpose: the fight now became general.
This, however, was only a small part of the Indian force&mdash;there were
four thousand of the party; they had nearly surrounded the camp, and
sheltered by the trees and grass as usual, were pouring in a deadly
fire upon the whites. St. Clair and all his officers behaved with
great courage. Finding his men falling fast around him, he ordered a
charge to be made with the bayonet. The men swept through the long
grass driving the Indians before them. The charge had no sooner ceased
than the Indians returned. Some forced their way into the camp, killed
the artillerists, wounded Colonel Butler, and seized the cannon.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Wounded as he was, Butler drove them back and recovered the guns.
Fired with new ardor, they returned again, once more entered the
camp&mdash;once more had possession of the cannon. All was now confusion
among the whites&mdash;it was impossible to restore order&mdash;the Indians
brought them down in masses&mdash;a retreat was all that remained. But they
were so hemmed in, that this seemed impossible. Colonel Darke was
ordered to charge the savages behind them, while Major Clarke with his
battalion was commanded to cover the rear of the army. These orders
were instantly obeyed, and the disorderly retreat commenced. The
Indians pursued them four miles, keeping up a running fight. At last
their chief, a Mississago, who had been trained to war by the British,
cried out to them to stop as they had killed enough. They then
returned to plunder the camp and divide the spoils, while the routed
troops continued their flight to Fort Jefferson, throwing away their
arms on the roadside that they might run faster. The Indians found in
the camp seven pieces of cannon, two hundred oxen, and several horses,
and had a great rejoicing. Well might the Mississago chief tell his
people they had killed enough: thirty-eight commissioned officers were
slain, and five hundred and ninety-three non-commissioned officers and
privates. Besides this, twenty-one officers and two hundred and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
forty-two men were wounded, some of whom soon died of their wounds.</p>

<p>This was a most disastrous battle for the whites, the most disastrous
they had yet known. The triumphant Indians were so delighted that they
could not leave the field, but kept up their revels from day to day.
Their revels, however, were at length broken up sorrowfully for them.
General Scott, hearing of the disaster, pushed on for the field with
one thousand mounted volunteers from Kentucky. The Indians were
dancing and singing, and riding the horses and oxen in high glee.
Scott instantly attacked them; two hundred were killed, their plunder
retaken, and the whole body of savages driven from the ground.</p>

<p>When Congress met soon after this, of course this wretched Indian war
was much talked of. It was proposed at once to raise three additional
regiments. Upon this a hot debate sprang up, the proposal was opposed
warmly; the opponents said that it would be necessary to lay a heavy
tax upon the people to raise them, that the war had been badly
managed, and should have been trusted to the militia in the west under
their own officers, and, moreover, that no success could be expected
so long as the British continued to hold posts in our own limits, and
furnish the Indians with arms, ammunition, and advice.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it was declared that the war was a just and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
necessary one. It was shown that in seven years (between 1783 and
1790), fifteen hundred people in Kentucky had been murdered or taken
captives by the savages; while in Pennsylvania and Virginia matters
had been well nigh as bad; that everything had been done to settle
matters peaceably but all to no purpose. In 1790, when a treaty was
proposed to the Indians of the Miami, they asked for thirty days to
deliberate&mdash;the request was granted&mdash;during those thirty days one
hundred and twenty persons had been killed or captured, and at the end
of the time the savages refused to give any answer to the proposal. At
last the vote was taken&mdash;the resolution passed&mdash;the war was to be
carried on&mdash;the regiments were to be raised.</p>

<p>General St. Clair now resigned the command of the army, and Major
General Anthony Wayne was appointed to succeed him. This appointment
gave great joy to the western people; the man was so well known among
them for his daring and bravery, that he commonly went by the name of
"Mad Anthony."</p>

<p>After much delay, the regiments were at last gathered together. Some
still opposed this war and in order to prove to them that the
government was willing to settle matters peaceably, if possible, two
officers&mdash;Colonel Hardin and Major Truman, were now sent off to
the Indians with proposals of peace. They were both seized and
murdered by the savages.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Wayne now started out upon his expedition. In a little time he passed
Fort Jefferson, took possession of St. Clair's fatal field, and
erected a fort there which he called Fort Recovery. He now learned the
truth of the stories about the British. A number of British soldiers
had come down from Detroit, and fortified themselves on the Miami of
the lakes. It was rumored too, that in some of the Indian fights and
massacres, the English were seen among them, fighting and urging them
on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
The General continued his march, and early in August reached the
confluence of the Miami of the Lakes and the Au Glaize. This was one
of the finest countries of the Indians, it was about thirty miles from
the British post, and he discovered here, that two thousand warriors
were near that post ready to meet him. Wayne was glad to hear this;
his army was quite as strong, and he longed to meet the savages. As he
drew near, however, he determined once more to have peace if possible,
without shedding blood. A message was sent to the Indians, urging them
not to follow the advice of bad men, to lay down their arms, to learn
to live peaceably, and their lives and their homes should be protected
by the government. An insolent answer, was all that was received in
reply.</p>

<p>Wayne's army now marched on in columns&mdash;a select battalion, under
Major Price, moving in front to reconnoitre. After marching about five
miles, Price was driven back by the fire of the Indians. As usual, the
cunning enemy was concealed; they had hid themselves in a thick wood a
little in advance of the British post, and here Price had received
their fire.</p>

<p>Wayne had now found out precisely where they were, and gave his orders
accordingly. The cavalry under Captain Campbell were commanded to
enter the wood in the rear of the Indians, between them and the river,
and charge their left flank. General Scott, with eleven hundred
mounted Kentucky volunteers, was to make a circuit in the opposite
direction, and attack the right. The infantry were to advance with
trailed arms, and rouse the enemy from their hiding-places. All being
ready, the infantry commenced their march. The Indians were at once
routed at the point of the bayonet. The infantry had done the whole;
Campbell and Scott had hardly the chance of doing any of the fighting.
In the course of an hour, they had driven the savages back two miles;
in fact, within gun-shot of the British post.</p>

<p>Wayne had now the possession of the whole ground, and here he remained
three days, burning their houses and cornfields above and below the
fort. One Englishman suffered, too, in this work of destruction.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Colonel M&#8216;Kee was known as a British trader, forever instigating the
Indians against the Americans, and Wayne did not scruple to burn all
his houses and stores likewise. Major Campbell, who commanded the
British fort, remonstrated at this, but Wayne gave him a bold and
determined answer in reply, and he had no more to say. A few words
from him would only have caused Wayne to drive him from the country.</p>

<p>The army now returned to Au Glaize, destroying all the houses,
villages, and crops by the way. It was one complete work of
destruction; within fifty miles of the river everything was destroyed.
In this campaign, Wayne had lost one hundred and seven men, and among
them were two brave officers&mdash;Captain Campbell and Lieutenant Towles,
but still he had gained a glorious victory. In his track, too, he had
not forgotten to build forts, to guard against the savages in future.</p>

<p>The story of the victory soon spread, and struck terror to the hearts
of the Indians north and south. They were restless and dissatisfied,
but war was sure destruction to them; they felt that it was idle to
attempt it further, and were ready to be quiet. In less than a year
from this time, Wayne concluded a treaty, in behalf of the United
States with all the Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio. The settlers
at last had peace&mdash;a blessing which they had long desired.

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH the return of peace, the settlers
were very happy. They could now go out, fell the forests, and
cultivate their fields in safety. There was no longer any wily savage
to lay in ambush, and keep them in perpetual anxiety. No man among
them was happier than Boone. He had been harassed by constant
struggles ever since he came to Kentucky, and these struggles with the
savages had made him a warrior rather than a hunter; but he could now
return to his darling passion. While others cultivated the ground, he
roamed through the wilderness with his rifle; he was now a hunter
indeed, spending weeks and months uninterruptedly in the forests By
day he moved where he pleased, and at night made his camp fearlessly
wherever the shades of night overtook him. His life was now
happier than ever.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
</p>

<p>Ere long, however, a cloud came over this happiness. Men began again
to crowd too closely upon him. In spite of all the early struggles
with the savages in Kentucky, emigrants had continued to flow into
that country. As early as 1783, Kentucky had been laid off into three
counties, and was that year formed into one district, and called the
District of Kentucky. In 1785, a convention was called at Danville,
and a memorial was addressed to the legislature of Virginia, proposing
that Kentucky should be erected into an independent State. In 1786,
the legislature of Virginia took the necessary steps for making the
new State, if Congress would admit it into the Union. In 1792,
Kentucky was admitted into the Union as one of the United States of
America. And now that peace had come to aid the settlers, emigration
flowed in more rapidly. Court-houses, jails, judges, lawyers,
sheriffs, and constables, began necessarily to be seen. Kentucky was
becoming every day a more settled and civilized region, and Boone's
heart grew sick. He had sought the wilderness, and men were fast
taking it away from him. He began to think of moving.</p>

<p>Another sorrow now came over him, and soon fixed in him the
determination to seek a new home. Men began to dispute with him the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
title to his land. The State of Kentucky had not been surveyed by the
government, and laid off into sections and townships, as the lands
north of the Ohio river have since been. The government of Virginia
had issued certificates, entitling the holder to locate where he
pleased the number of acres called for. To actual settlers, who should
build a cabin, raise a crop, &amp;c., pre-emption rights to such lands as
they might occupy were also granted. Entries of these certificates
were made in a way so loose, that different men frequently located the
same lands; one title would often lap over upon another; and almost
all the titles conferred in this way became known as "the lapping, or
shingle titles." Continued lawsuits sprang out of this state of
things; no man knew what belonged to him. Boone had made these loose
entries of his lands: his titles, of course, were disputed. It was
curious to see the old man in a court of law, which he thoroughly
despised, fighting for his rights. He was greatly provoked; he had
explored and redeemed the wilderness, as he said, borne every hardship
with his wife and children, only to be cheated at last. But the law
decided against him; he lost his lands, and would now no longer remain
in that region.</p>

</div>

<p>Hearing that buffaloes and deer were still plenty about the Great
Kanhawa river, he started thither with his wife and children, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
settled near Point Pleasant. Here he remained several years. He was
disappointed in not finding game as he expected, and was more of a
farmer here than ever before; he turned his attention earnestly to
agriculture, and was very successful in raising good crops. Still he
was dissatisfied; he longed for the wilderness. Hunting and trapping
were the constant thoughts of his life.</p>

<p>While living here, he met accidentally with a party of men who had
been out upon the upper waters of the Missouri. These men talked of
the beauty of that region: they had stories to tell of grizzly bears,
buffaloes, deer, beavers, and otters&mdash;in fact, the region was in their
eyes "the paradise for a hunter." Fired by these stories, Boone
resolved to go there. Accordingly, he gathered together all that he
possessed, and with his wife and family started for Missouri, driving
his herds and cattle before him. It was strange to see an old man thus
vigorous in seeking a new home. He was an object of surprise to every
one. When he reached Cincinnati, on his route, some one, marking his
age, and surprised at his adventure, asked him how, at his time of
life, he could leave all the comforts of home, for the wilderness. His
answer shows his whole character: "Too much crowded, too much
crowded," said he; "I want more elbow-room." Travelling on, he at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
length reached Missouri, and, proceeding about fifty miles above St.
Louis, settled in what is now St. Charles county.</p>

<p>Here everything pleased Boone. The country, as you know, was then in
the possession of the French and Spanish, and the old laws by which
their territories were governed were still in force there. They had no
constitution, no king, no legislature, no judges, lawyers, or
sheriffs. An officer called the commandant, and the priests, exercised
all the authority that was needed. The horses, cattle, flocks, and
herds of these people all grazed together upon the same commons; in
fact, they were living here almost in primitive simplicity. Boone's
character for honesty and courage soon became known among them, and he
was appointed by the Spanish commandant the commandant over the
district of St. Charles.</p>

<p>Boone now had the satisfaction of settling all his children
comfortably around him, and in the unbroken wilderness his hunting and
trapping was unmolested. In his office of commandant he gave great
satisfaction to every one, and continued to occupy it until Missouri
was purchased by our government from the French. When that purchase
was made, American enterprise soon came upon him again&mdash;he was once
more crowded by his fellow-men. His old office of commandant was soon
merged in the new order of things&mdash;his hunting-grounds were invaded by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
others. Nothing remained for him now, but to submit to his fate; he
was too old to move again, nor indeed did he know where to go. He
continued his old habits, as well he might. He would start out with
his rifle, now marked with a paper sight to guide his dim eye, and be
absent from his home for weeks. Nearly eighty years had passed over
him, yet he would lie in wait near the salt-licks, and bring down his
buffalo or his deer, and as bravely and cheerily as in his younger
days, would he cut down bee-trees. As the light-hearted Frenchmen
swept up the river in their fleets of periogues on their hunting
excursions, Boone would cheer them as they passed, and sigh for his
younger days that he might join their parties. He was a complete
Nimrod, now almost worn out.</p>

<p>It was while he was living here, I think, that he was met by that very
interesting man, Mr. Audubon, the natural historian of our continent.
He was struck with the man, and has given the story of his interview
with Boone. It is so illustrative of the character of the hunter, that
I give it to you in Mr. Audubon's words.</p>

<p>"Daniel Boone, or as he was usually called in the western country,
Colonel Boone, happened to spend a night under the same roof with me,
more than twenty years ago. We had returned from a shooting excursion,
in the course of which his extraordinary skill in the management of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
rifle had been fully displayed. On retiring to the room appropriated
to that remarkable individual and myself for the night, I felt anxious
to know more of his exploits and adventures than I did, and
accordingly took the liberty of proposing numerous questions to him.
The stature and general appearance of this wanderer of the western
forests, approached the gigantic. His chest was broad and prominent;
his muscular powers displayed themselves in every limb; his
countenance gave indication of his great courage, enterprise, and
perseverance; and when he spoke, the very motion of his lips brought
the impression, that whatever he uttered could not be otherwise than
strictly true. I undressed, while he merely took off his hunting
shirt, and arranged a few folds of blankets on the floor; choosing
rather to lie there, as he observed, than on the softest bed. When we
had both disposed of ourselves, each after his own fashion, he related
to me the following account of his powers of memory, which I lay
before you, kind reader, in his own words, hoping that the simplicity
of his style may prove interesting to you.</p>

<p>"I was once," said he, "on a hunting expedition on the banks of the
Green river, when the lower parts of this (Kentucky) were still in the
hands of nature, and none but the sons of the soil were looked upon as
its lawful proprietors. We Virginians had for some time been waging a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
war of intrusion upon them, and I, among the rest, rambled through
the woods, in pursuit of their race, as I now would follow the tracks
of any ravenous animal. The Indians outwitted me one dark night, and I
was as unexpectedly as suddenly made a prisoner by them. The trick had
been managed with great skill; for no sooner had I extinguished the
fire of my camp, and laid me down to rest, in full security, as I
thought, than I felt myself seized by an indistinguishable number of
hands, and was immediately pinioned, as if about to be led to the
scaffold for execution. To have attempted to be refractory, would have
proved useless and dangerous to my life; and I suffered myself to be
removed from my camp to theirs, a few miles distant, without uttering
even a word of complaint. You are aware, I dare say, that to act in
this manner, was the best policy, as you understand that by so doing,
I proved to the Indians at once, that I was born and bred as fearless
of death as any of themselves.</p>

<p>"When we reached the camp, great rejoicings were exhibited. Two
squaws, and a few papooses, appeared particularly delighted at the
sight of me, and I was assured, by very unequivocal gestures and
words, that, on the morrow, the mortal enemy of the red-skins would
cease to live. I never opened my lips, but was busy contriving some
scheme which might enable me to give the rascals the slip before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
dawn. The women immediately fell a searching about my hunting-shirt
for whatever they might think valuable, and fortunately for me, soon
found my flask, filled with <i>Monongahela</i> (that is, reader, strong
whiskey). A terrific grin was exhibited on their murderous
countenances, while my heart throbbed with joy at the anticipation of
their intoxication. The crew immediately began to beat their bellies
and sing, as they passed the bottle from mouth to mouth. How often did
I wish the flask ten times its size, and filled with aquafortis! I
observed that the squaws drank more freely than the warriors, and
again my spirits were about to be depressed, when the report of a gun
was heard at a distance. The Indians all jumped on their feet. The
singing and drinking were both brought to a stand; and I saw with
inexpressible joy, the men walk off to some distance, and talk to the
squaws. I knew that they were consulting about me, and I foresaw, that
in a few moments the warriors would go to discover the cause of the
gun having been fired so near their camp. I expected the squaws would
be left to guard me. Well, sir, it was just so. They returned; the men
took up their guns and walked away. The squaws sat down again, and in
less than five minutes they had my bottle up to their dirty mouths,
gurgling down their throats the remains of the whiskey.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
</p>

<p>"With what pleasure did I see them becoming more and more drunk, until
the liquor took such hold of them that it was quite impossible for
these women to be of any service. They tumbled down, rolled about, and
began to snore; when I, having no other chance of freeing myself from
the cords that fastened me, rolled over and over toward the fire, and
after a short time burned them asunder. I rose on my feet; stretched
my stiffened sinews; snatched up my rifle, and, for once in my life,
spared that of Indians. I now recollect how desirous I once or twice
felt to lay open the sculls of the wretches with my tomahawk; but when
I again thought upon killing beings unprepared and unable to defend
themselves, it looked like murder without need, and I gave up the
idea.</p>

<p>"But, sir, I felt determined to mark the spot, and walking to a
thrifty ash sapling, I cut out of it three large chips, and ran off. I
soon reached the river; soon crossed it, and threw myself deep into
the canebrakes, imitating the tracks of an Indian with my feet, so
that no chance might be left for those from whom I had escaped to
overtake me.</p>

<p>"It is now nearly twenty years since this happened, and more than five
since I left the whites' settlements, which I might probably never
have visited again, had I not been called on as a witness in a lawsuit
that was pending in Kentucky and which, I really believe, would never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
have been settled, had I not come forward, and established the
beginning of a certain boundary line. This is the story, sir.</p>

<p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash; moved from old Virginia into Kentucky, and having
a large tract granted to him in the new state, laid claim to a certain
parcel of land adjoining Green river, and as chance would have it, he
took for one of his corners the very ash tree on which I had made my
mark, and finished his survey of some thousands of acres, beginning,
as it is expressed in the deed, 'at an ash marked by three distinct
notches of the tomahawk of a white man.'</p>

<p>"The tree had grown much, and the bark had covered the marks; but,
some how or other, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; heard from some one all that I
have already said to you, and thinking that I might remember the spot
alluded to in the deed, but which was no longer discoverable, wrote
for me to come and try at least to find the place on the tree. His
letter mentioned, that all my expenses should be paid; and not caring
much about once more going back to Kentucky, I started and met
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. After some conversation, the affair with the
Indians came to my recollection. I considered for a while, and began
to think that after all, I could find the very spot, as well as the
tree, if it was yet standing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
</p>

<p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and I mounted our horses, and off we went to the
Green river bottoms. After some difficulties, for you must be aware,
sir, that great changes had taken place in these woods, I found at
last the spot where I had crossed the river, and waiting for the moon
to rise, made for the course in which I thought the ash tree grew. On
approaching the place, I felt as if the Indians were there still, and
as if I was still a prisoner among them. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and I
camped near what I conceived the spot, and waited till the return of
day.</p>

<p>"At the rising of the sun I was on foot, and after a good deal of
musing, thought that an ash tree then in sight must be the very one on
which I had made my mark. I felt as if there could be no doubt of it,
and mentioned my thought to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. 'Well, Colonel Boone,'
said he, 'if you think so, I hope it may prove true, but we must have
some witnesses; do you stay hereabout, and I will go and bring some of
the settlers whom I know.' I agreed. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; trotted off,
and I, to pass the time, rambled about to see if a deer was still
living in the land. But ah! sir, what a wonderful difference thirty
years make in the country! Why, at the time when I was caught by the
Indians, you would not have walked out in any direction for more than
a mile without shooting a buck or a bear. There were ten thousands of
buffaloes on the hills in Kentucky; the land looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
as if it would never become poor; and to hunt in those days was a
pleasure indeed. But when I was left to myself on the banks of the
Green river, I dare say for the last time in my life, a few <i>signs</i>
only of deer were to be seen, and as to a deer itself, I saw none.</p>

<p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash; returned, accompanied by three gentlemen.
They looked upon me as if I had been Washington himself, and walked to
the ash tree which I now called my own, as if in quest of a long lost
treasure. I took an axe from one of them and cut a few chips off the
bark. Still no signs were to be seen. So I cut again, until I thought
it time to be cautious, and I scraped and worked away with my butcher
knife, until I <i>did</i> come to where my tomahawk had left an impression
in the wood. We now went regularly to work, and scraped at the tree
with care, until three hacks, as plain as any three notches ever were,
could be seen. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and the other gentlemen were
astonished, and, I must allow, I was as much surprised as pleased,
myself. I made affidavit of this remarkable occurrence in the presence
of these gentlemen. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; gained his cause. I left Green
river, for ever, and came to where we now are; and, sir, I wish you a
good night."</p>

<p>Here, too, it was that he resided, when Mr. Astor attempted to carry
out his magnificent design, of settling Astoria on the western coast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of our continent, and belting the earth with his commerce. When you
are older, you can read the beautiful history of that attempt, written
by our distinguished countryman Mr. Irving. As the party, bound for
the far west, moved up the Missouri, Boone stood upon the banks of the
stream, looking anxiously after them. It was just the adventure to
please him. There the old man stood, leaning upon his rifle, his dim
eye lighted up as he gazed upon them, and his heart heavy with sorrow,
because he was too old to press with them, beyond the mountains.
<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Other sorrows than those of age, now crept upon him. His wife, who had
been to him all that was good, was now taken from him, and the old man
was left widowed. With a sad heart he now went to the home of his son,
Major Nathan Boone.</p>

<p>The last war with England now broke out, too, and penetrated even the
wilds of Missouri. It was the worst of all warfare&mdash;the savages were
let loose upon them. Boone was too old to act the part of a soldier,
but he sent off many substitutes in his sons.</p>

<p>When peace returned, the spirit of the old man rallied; his ruling
passion was still with him. The woods were again his home, his rifle
his companion; and thus he lived on, through a vigorous old age, with
a passion as strong as ever, a hunter almost to the very day of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
death. For when, in 1818, death came upon him, he had but little
notice of its approach. With no disease but old age, which had seemed
comparatively vigorous almost to the day of his departure, he died in
his eighty-fourth year. His mind was unclouded and he passed from this
world calmly and quietly.</p>

<p>I have but one thing more to say. You remember Daniel Boone's
schoolboy days, of which I have spoken. He left school a perfectly
ignorant lad. Some say that he afterward learned to write, and produce
as an evidence, a little narrative of his wanderings in Kentucky,
supposed to be written by himself. I believe, however, that to the day
of his death, he could not write his name. The narrative spoken of,
was, I think, dictated in some degree by him, and written by another.
At all events, the story is interesting and curious, and, as such, I
have placed it for your benefit, as an appendix to this volume.

It is said by some that this man did not thus leave them.
Their story is, that the three started out upon a hunt; that this man
was separated from the Boones, and became entangled in a swamp. The
Boones searched for him, but could not find him. Afterward, they found
fragments of his clothes, which convinced them that the poor man had
been torn to pieces by wolves.

Daniel Boone, however, tells a different story. He says that the man
left them, "and returned home by himself;" and I have preferred his

This mode of marking their track is often practised by
hunters in the woods. As they pass through the forest, they mark the
trees by cutting off a small piece of the bark. This enables them
again to find the same pathway, and is commonly called "blazing the
track."</p><br /></div>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>URIOSITY is natural to the soul of man, and interesting objects have
a powerful influence on our affections. Let these influencing powers
actuate, by the permission or disposal of Providence, from selfish or
social views, yet in time the mysterious will of Heaven is unfolded,
and we behold our conduct, from whatsoever motives excited, operating
to answer the important designs of Heaven. Thus we behold Kentucky,
lately a howling wilderness, the habitation of savages and wild
beasts, become a fruitful field; this region, so favorably
distinguished by nature, now become the habitation of civilization,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
at a period unparalleled in history, in the midst of a raging war, and
under all the disadvantages of emigration to a country so remote from
the inhabited parts of the continent. Here, where the hand of violence
shed the blood of the innocent; where the horrid yells of savages and
the groans of the distressed sounded in our ears, we now hear the
praises and adorations of our Creator; where wretched wigwams stood,
the miserable abodes of savages, we behold the foundations of cities
laid, that, in all probability, will equal the glory of the greatest
upon earth. And we view Kentucky, situated on the fertile banks of the
great Ohio, rising from obscurity to shine with splendor equal to any
other of the stars of the American hemisphere.</p>

<p>The settling of this region well deserves a place in history. Most of
the memorable events I have myself been exercised in; and, for the
satisfaction of the public, will briefly relate the circumstances of
my adventures, and scenes of life, from my first movement to this
country until this day.</p>

<p>It was on the first of May, in the year 1769, that I resigned my
domestic happiness for a time, and left my family and peaceable
habitation on the Yadkin river, in North Carolina, to wander through
the wilderness of America, in quest of the country of Kentucky, in
company with John Finley, John Stewart, Joseph Holden, James Monay,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and William Cool. We proceeded successfully, and after a long and
fatiguing journey through a mountainous wilderness, in a westward
direction, on the 7th day of June following we found ourselves on Red
river, where John Finley had formerly been trading with the Indians,
and, from the top of an eminence, saw with pleasure the beautiful
level of Kentucky. Here let me observe that for some time we had
experienced the most uncomfortable weather, as a prelibation of our
future sufferings. At this place we encamped, and made a shelter to
defend us from the inclement season, and began to hunt and reconnoitre
the country. We found everywhere abundance of wild beasts of all
sorts, through this vast forest. The buffalo were more frequent than I
have seen cattle in the settlements, browsing on the leaves of the
cane, or cropping the herbage on those extensive plains, fearless,
because ignorant, of the violence of man. Sometimes we saw hundreds in
a drove, and the numbers about the salt springs were amazing. In this
forest, the habitation of beasts of every kind natural to America, we
practised hunting with great success until the 22d day of December
following.</p>
</div>

<p>This day John Stewart and I had a pleasing ramble, but fortune changed
the scene in the close of it. We had passed through a great forest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
on which stood myriads of trees, some gay with blossoms, and others
rich with fruits. Nature was here a series of wonders, and a fund of
delight. Here she displayed her ingenuity and industry in a variety of
flowers and fruits, beautifully colored, elegantly shaped, and
charmingly flavored; and we were diverted with innumerable animals
presenting themselves perpetually to our view. In the decline of the
day, near Kentucky river, as we ascended the brow of a small hill, a
number of Indians rushed out of a thick canebrake upon us, and made us
prisoners. The time of our sorrow was now arrived, and the scene fully
opened. The Indians plundered us of what we had, and kept us in
confinement seven days, treating us with common savage usage. During
this time we discovered no uneasiness or desire to escape, which made
them less suspicious of us; but in the dead of night, as we lay in a
thick canebrake by a large fire, when sleep had locked up their
senses, my situation not disposing me for rest, I touched my
companion, and gently awoke him. We improved this favorable
opportunity, and departed, leaving them to take their rest, and
speedily directed our course toward our old camp, but found it
plundered, and the company dispersed and gone home. About this time my
brother, Squire Boone, with another adventurer, who came to explore
the country shortly after us, was wandering through the forest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
determined to find me if possible, and accidentally found our camp.
Notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances of our company, and our
dangerous situation, as surrounded with hostile savages, our meeting
so fortunately in the wilderness made us reciprocally sensible of the
utmost satisfaction. So much does friendship triumph over misfortune,
that sorrows and sufferings vanish at the meeting not only of real
friends, but of the most distant acquaintances, and substitute
happiness in their room.</p>

<p>Soon after this, my companion in captivity, John Stewart, was killed
by the savages, and the man that came with my brother returned home by
himself. We were then in a dangerous, helpless situation, exposed
daily to perils and death among savages and wild beasts&mdash;not a white
man in the country but ourselves.</p>

<p>Thus situated, many hundred miles from our families in the howling
wilderness, I believe few would have equally enjoyed the happiness we
experienced. I often observed to my brother, "You see now how little
nature requires, to be satisfied. Felicity, the companion of content,
is rather found in our own breasts than in the enjoyment of external
things; and I firmly believe it requires but a little philosophy to
make a man happy in whatsoever state he is. This consists in a full
resignation to the will of Providence; and a resigned soul finds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
pleasure in a path strewed with briers and thorns."</p>

<p>We continued not in a state of indolence, but hunted every day, and
prepared a little cottage to defend us from the winter storms. We
remained there undisturbed during the winter; and on the 1st day of
May, 1770, my brother returned home to the settlement by himself, for
a new recruit of horses and ammunition, leaving me by myself, without
bread, salt, or sugar, without company of my fellow-creatures, or even
a horse or dog. I confess I never before was under greater necessity
of exercising philosophy and fortitude. A few days I passed
uncomfortably. The idea of a beloved wife and family, and their
anxiety upon the account of my absence and exposed situation, made
sensible impressions on my heart. A thousand dreadful apprehensions
presented themselves to my view, and had undoubtedly disposed me to
melancholy, if further indulged.</p>

<p>One day I undertook a tour through the country, and the diversity and
beauties of nature I met with in this charming season, expelled every
gloomy and vexatious thought. Just at the close of day the gentle
gales retired, and left the place to the disposal of a profound calm.
Not a breeze shook the most tremulous leaf. I had gained the summit of
a commanding ridge, and, looking round with astonishing delight,
beheld the ample plains, the beauteous tracts below. On the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
hand, I surveyed the famous river Ohio that rolled in silent dignity,
marking the western boundary of Kentucky with inconceivable grandeur.
At a vast distance I beheld the mountains lift their venerable brows,
and penetrate the clouds. All things were still. I kindled a fire near
a fountain of sweet water, and feasted on the loin of a buck, which a
few hours before I had killed. The sullen shades of night soon
overspread the whole hemisphere, and the earth seemed to gasp after
the hovering moisture. My roving excursion this day had fatigued my
body, and diverted my imagination. I laid me down to sleep, and I
awoke not until the sun had chased away the night. I continued this
tour, and in a few days explored a considerable part of the country,
each day equally pleased as the first. I returned again to my old
camp, which was not disturbed in my absence. I did not confine my
lodging to it, but often reposed in thick canebrakes, to avoid the
savages, who, I believe, often visited my camp, but, fortunately for
me, in my absence. In this situation I was constantly exposed to
danger and death. How unhappy such a situation for a man tormented
with fear, which is vain if no danger comes, and if it does, only
augments the pain! It was my happiness to be destitute of this
afflicting passion, with which I had the greatest reason to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
affected. The prowling wolves diverted my nocturnal hours with
perpetual howlings; and the various species of animals in this vast
forest, in the daytime, were continually in my view.</p>

<p>Thus I was surrounded by plenty in the midst of want. I was happy in
the midst of dangers and inconveniences. In such a diversity, it was
impossible I should be disposed to melancholy. No populous city, with
all the varieties of commerce and stately structures, could afford so
much pleasure to my mind as the beauties of nature I found here.</p>

<p>Thus, through an uninterrupted scene of sylvan pleasures, I spent the
time until the 27th day of July following, when my brother, to my
great felicity, met me, according to appointment, at our old camp.
Shortly after, we left this place, not thinking it safe to stay there
longer, and proceeded to Cumberland river, reconnoitring that part of
the country until March, 1771, and giving names to the different
waters.</p>

<p>Soon after, I returned home to my family, with a determination to
bring them as soon as possible to live in Kentucky, which I esteemed a
second paradise, at the risk of my life and fortune.</p>

<p>I returned safe to my old habitation, and found my family in happy
circumstances. I sold my farm on the Yadkin, and what goods we could
not carry with us; and on the 25th day of September,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
1773, bade a farewell to our friends, and proceeded on our journey to
Kentucky, in company with five families more, and forty men that
joined us in Powel's Valley, which is one hundred and fifty miles from
the now settled parts of Kentucky. This promising beginning was soon
overcast with a cloud of adversity; for, upon the 10th day of October,
the rear of our company was attacked by a number of Indians, who
killed six, and wounded one man. Of these, my eldest son was one that
fell in the action. Though we defended ourselves, and repulsed the
enemy, yet this unhappy affair scattered out cattle, brought us into
extreme difficulty, and so discouraged the whole company, that we
retreated forty miles, to the settlement on Clinch river. We had
passed over two mountains, viz., Powel's and Walden's, and were
approaching Cumberland mountain when this adverse fortune overtook us.
These mountains are in the wilderness, as we pass from the old
settlements in Virginia to Kentucky, are ranged in a southwest and
northeast direction, are of a great length and breadth, and not far
distant from each other. Over these, nature hath formed passes that
are less difficult than might be expected, from a view of such huge
piles. The aspect of these cliffs is so wild and horrid, that it is
impossible to behold them without terror. The spectator is apt to
imagine that nature had formerly suffered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
 some violent convulsion, and that these are the dismembered
remains of the dreadful shock: the ruins, not of Persepolis or
Palmyra, but of the world!</p>

<p>I remained with my family on Clinch until the 6th of June, 1774, when
I and one Michael Stoner were solicited by Governor Dunmore of
Virginia to go to the falls of the Ohio, to conduct into the
settlement a number of surveyors that had been sent thither by him
some months before; this country having about this time drawn the
attention of many adventurers. We immediately complied with the
Governor's request, and conducted in the surveyors&mdash;completing a tour
of eight hundred miles, through many difficulties, in sixty-two days.</p>

<p>Soon after I returned home, I was ordered to take the command of three
garrisons during the campaign which Governor Dunmore carried on
against the Shawanese Indians; after the conclusion of which, the
militia was discharged from each garrison, and I, being relieved from
my post, was solicited by a number of North Carolina gentlemen, that
were about purchasing the lands lying on the south side of Kentucky
river, from the Cherokee Indians, to attend their treaty at Wataga in
March, 1775, to negotiate with them, and mention the boundaries of the
purchase. This I accepted; and, at the request of the same gentlemen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
undertook to mark out a road in the best passage from the settlement
through the wilderness to Kentucky, with such assistance as I thought
necessary to employ for such an important undertaking.</p>

<p>I soon began this work, having collected a number of enterprising men,
well armed. We proceeded with all possible expedition until we came
within fifteen miles of where Boonesborough now stands, and where we
were fired upon by a party of Indians that killed two, and wounded two
of our number; yet, although surprised and taken at a disadvantage, we
stood our ground. This was on the 20th of March, 1775. Three days
after, we were fired upon again, and had two men killed, and three
wounded. Afterward we proceeded on to Kentucky river without
opposition; and on the 1st day of April began to erect the fort of
Boonesborough at a salt lick, about sixty yards from the river, on the
south side.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, the Indians killed one of our men. We were busily
employed in building this fort until the 14th day of June following,
without any further opposition from the Indians; and having finished
the works, I returned to my family, on Clinch.</p>

<p>In a short time I proceeded to remove my family from Clinch to this
garrison, where we arrived safe, without any other difficulties than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
such as are common to this passage; my wife and daughter being the
first white women that ever stood on the banks of Kentucky river.</p>

<p>On the 24th day of December following, we had one man killed, and one
wounded, by the Indians, who seemed determined to persecute us for
erecting this fortification.</p>

<p>On the 14th day of July, 1776, two of Colonel Calaway's daughters, and
one of mine, were taken prisoners near the fort. I immediately pursued
the Indians with only eight men, and on the 16th overtook them, killed
two of the party, and recovered the girls. The same day on which this
attempt was made, the Indians divided themselves into different
parties, and attacked several forts, which were shortly before this
time erected, doing a great deal of mischief. This was extremely
distressing to the new settlers. The innocent husbandman was shot
down, while busy in cultivating the soil for his family's supply. Most
of the cattle around the stations were destroyed. They continued their
hostilities in this manner until the 15th of April, 1777, when they
attacked Boonesborough with a party of above one hundred in number,
killed one man, and wounded four. Their loss in this attack was not
certainly known to us.</p>

<p>On the 4th day of July following, a party of about two hundred Indians
attacked Boonesborough,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
 killed one man, and wounded two. They
besieged us forty-eight hours, during which time seven of them were
killed, and, at last, finding themselves not likely to prevail, they
raised the siege, and departed.</p>

<p>The Indians had disposed their warriors in different parties at this
time, and attacked the different garrisons, to prevent their assisting
each other, and did much injury to the distressed inhabitants.</p>

<p>On the 19th day of this month, Colonel Logan's fort was besieged by a
party of about two hundred Indians. During this dreadful siege they
did a great deal of mischief, distressed the garrison, in which were
only fifteen men, killed two, and wounded one. The enemy's loss was
uncertain, from the common practice which the Indians have of carrying
off their dead in time of battle. Colonel Harrod's fort was then
defended by only sixty-five men, and Boonesborough by twenty-two,
there being no more forts or white men in the country, except at the
Falls, a considerable distance from these: and all, taken
collectively, were but a handful to the numerous warriors that were
everywhere dispersed through the country, intent upon doing all the
mischief that savage barbarity could invent. Thus we passed through a
scene of sufferings that exceeds description.</p>

<p>On the 25th of this month, a reinforcement of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
 forty-five men arrived
from North Carolina, and about the 20th of August following, Colonel
Bowman arrived with one hundred men from Virginia. Now we began to
strengthen; and hence, for the space of six weeks, we had skirmishes
with Indians, in one quarter or other, almost every day.</p>

<p>The savages now learned the superiority of the Long Knife, as they
call the Virginians, by experience; being outgeneralled in almost
every battle. Our affairs began to wear a new aspect, and the enemy,
not daring to venture on open war, practised secret mischief at times.</p>

<p>On the 1st day of January, 1778, I went with a party of thirty men to
the Blue Licks, on Licking river, to make salt for the different
garrisons in the country.</p>

<p>On the 7th day of February, as I was hunting to procure meat for the
company, I met with a party of one hundred and two Indians, and two
Frenchmen, on their march against Boonesborough, that place being
particularly the object of the enemy.</p>

<p>They pursued, and took me; and brought me on the 8th day to the Licks,
where twenty-seven of my party were, three of them having previously
returned home with the salt. I, knowing it was impossible for them to
escape, capitulated with the enemy, and, at a distance, in their
view,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
 gave notice to my men of their situation, with orders not to
resist, but surrender themselves captives.</p>

<p>The generous usage the Indians had promised before in my capitulation,
was afterward fully complied with, and we proceeded with them as
prisoners to Old Chilicothe, the principal Indian town on Little
Miami, where we arrived, after an uncomfortable journey in very severe
weather, on the 18th day of February, and received as good treatment
as prisoners could expect from savages. On the 10th day of March
following, I and ten of my men were conducted by forty Indians to
Detroit, where we arrived the 30th day, and were treated by Governor
Hamilton, the British commander at that post, with great humanity.</p>

<p>During our travels, the Indians entertained me well, and their
affection for me was so great, that they utterly refused to leave me
there with the others, although the Governor offered them one hundred
pounds sterling for me, on purpose to give me a parole to go home.
Several English gentlemen there, being sensible of my adverse fortune,
and touched with human sympathy, generously offered a friendly supply
for my wants, which I refused, with many thanks for their
kindness&mdash;adding, that I never expected it would be in my power to
recompense such unmerited generosity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians left my men in captivity with the British at Detroit, and
on the 10th day of April brought me toward Old Chilicothe, where we
arrived on the 25th day of the same month. This was a long and
fatiguing march, through an exceeding fertile country, remarkable for
fine springs and streams of water. At Chilicothe I spent my time as
comfortably as I could expect; was adopted, according to their custom,
into a family, where I became a son, and had a great share in the
affection of my new parents, brothers, sisters, and friends. I was
exceedingly familiar and friendly with them, always appearing as
cheerful and satisfied as possible, and they put great confidence in
me. I often went a hunting with them, and frequently gained their
applause for my activity at our shooting-matches. I was careful not to
exceed many of them in shooting; for no people are more envious than
they in this sport. I could observe, in their countenances and
gestures, the greatest expressions of joy when they exceeded me; and,
when the reverse happened, of envy. The Shawanese king took great
notice of me, and treated me with profound respect and entire
friendship, often intrusting me to hunt at my liberty. I frequently
returned with the spoils of the woods, and as often presented some of
what I had taken to him, expressive of duty to my sovereign. My food
and lodging were in common with them; not so good, indeed, as I could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
desire, but necessity made everything acceptable.</p>

<p>I now began to meditate an escape, and carefully avoided their
suspicions, continuing with them at Old Chilicothe until the 1st day
of June following, and then was taken by them to the salt springs on
Scioto, and kept there making salt ten days. During this time I hunted
some for them, and found the land, for a great extent about this
river, to exceed the soil of Kentucky, if possible, and remarkably
well watered.</p>

<p>When I returned to Chilicothe, alarmed to see four hundred and fifty
Indians, of their choicest warriors, painted and armed in a fearful
manner, ready to march against Boonesborough, I determined to escape
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>On the 16th, before sunrise, I departed in the most secret manner, and
arrived at Boonesborough on the 20th, after a journey of one hundred
and sixty miles, during which I had but one meal.</p>

<p>I found our fortress in a bad state of defence; but we proceeded
immediately to repair our flanks, strengthen our gates and posterns,
and form double bastions, which we completed in ten days. In this time
we daily expected the arrival of the Indian army; and at length, one
of my fellow-prisoners, escaping from them, arrived, informing us that
the enemy had, on account of my departure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
 postponed their expedition
three weeks. The Indians had spies out viewing our movements, and were
greatly alarmed with our increase in number and fortifications. The
grand councils of the nations were held frequently, and with more
deliberation than usual. They evidently saw the approaching hour when
the Long Knife would dispossess them of their desirable habitations;
and, anxiously concerned for futurity, determined utterly to extirpate
the whites out of Kentucky. We were not intimidated by their
movements, but frequently gave them proofs of our courage.</p>

<p>About the first of August, I made an incursion into the Indian country
with a party of nineteen men, in order to surprise a small town up
Scioto, called Paint Creek Town. We advanced within four miles
thereof, where we met a party of thirty Indians on their march against
Boonesborough, intending to join the others from Chilicothe. A smart
fight ensued between us for some time; at length the savages gave way
and fled. We had no loss on our side; the enemy had one killed, and
two wounded. We took from them three horses, and all their baggage;
and being informed, by two of our number that went to their town, that
the Indians had entirely evacuated it, we proceeded no further, and
returned with all possible expedition to assist our garrison against
the other party. We passed by them on the sixth day,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
 and on the seventh we arrived safe at Boonesborough.</p>

<p>On the 8th, the Indian army arrived, being four hundred and forty-four
in number, commanded by Captain Duquesne, eleven other Frenchmen, and
some of their own chiefs, and marched up within view of our fort, with
British and French colors flying; and having sent a summons to me, in
his Britannic Majesty's name, to surrender the fort, I requested two
days' consideration, which was granted.</p>

<p>It was now a critical period with us. We were a small number in the
garrison&mdash;a powerful army before our walls, whose appearance
proclaimed inevitable death, fearfully painted, and marking their
footsteps with desolation. Death was preferable to captivity; and if
taken by storm, we must inevitably be devoted to destruction. In this
situation we concluded to maintain our garrison, if possible. We
immediately proceeded to collect what we could of our horses and other
cattle, and bring them through the posterns into the fort; and in the
evening of the 9th, I returned answer that we were determined to
defend our fort while a man was living. "Now," said I to their
commander, who stood attentively hearing my sentiments, "we laugh at
your formidable preparations; but thank you for giving us notice and
time to provide for our defence. Your efforts will not prevail; for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
our gates shall for ever deny you admittance." Whether this answer
affected their courage or not I can not tell; but, contrary to our
expectations, they formed a scheme to deceive us, declaring it was
their orders, from Governor Hamilton, to take us captives, and not to
destroy us; but if nine of us would come out, and treat with them,
they would immediately withdraw their forces from our walls, and
return home peaceably. This sounded grateful in our ears; and we
agreed to the proposal.</p>

<p>We held the treaty within sixty yards of the garrison, on purpose to
divert them from a breach of honor, as we could not avoid suspicions
of the savages. In this situation the articles were formally agreed
to, and signed; and the Indians told us it was customary with them on
such occasions for two Indians to shake hands with every white man in
the treaty, as an evidence of entire friendship. We agreed to this
also, but were soon convinced their policy was to take us prisoners.
They immediately grappled us; but, although surrounded by hundreds of
savages, we extricated ourselves from them, and escaped all safe into
the garrison, except one that was wounded, through a heavy fire from
their army. They immediately attacked us on every side, and a constant
heavy fire ensued between us, day and night, for the space of nine days.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In this time the enemy began to undermine our fort, which was situated
sixty yards from Kentucky river. They began at the water-mark, and
proceeded in the bank some distance, which we understood, by their
making the water muddy with the clay; and we immediately proceeded to
disappoint their design, by cutting a trench across their subterranean
passage. The enemy, discovering our counter-mine, by the clay we threw
out of the fort, desisted from that stratagem: and experience now fully
convincing them that neither their power nor policy could effect their
purpose, on the 20th day of August they raised the siege and departed.</p>

<p>During this siege, which threatened death in every form, we had two
men killed, and four wounded, besides a number of cattle. We killed of
the enemy thirty-seven, and wounded a great number. After they were
gone, we picked up one hundred and twenty-five pounds weight of
bullets, besides what stuck in the logs of our fort, which certainly
is a great proof of their industry. Soon after this, I went into the
settlement, and nothing worthy of a place in this account passed in my
affairs for some time.</p>

<p>During my absence from Kentucky, Colonel Bowman carried on an
expedition against the Shawanese, at Old Chilicothe, with one hundred
and sixty men, in July, 1779. Here they arrived undiscovered, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
battle ensued, which lasted until ten o'clock, A.M., when Colonel
Bowman, finding he could not succeed at this time, retreated about
thirty miles. The Indians, in the mean time, collecting all their
forces, pursued and overtook him, when a smart fight continued near
two hours, not to the advantage of Colonel Bowman's party.</p>

<p>Colonel Harrod proposed to mount a number of horse, and furiously to
rush upon the savages, who at this time fought with remarkable fury.
This desperate step had a happy effect, broke their line of battle,
and the savages fled on all sides. In these two battles we had nine
killed, and one wounded. The enemy's loss uncertain, only two scalps
being taken.</p>

<p>On the 22d day of June, 1780, a large party of Indians and Canadians,
about six hundred in number, commanded by Colonel Bird, attacked
Riddle's and Martin's stations, at the forks of Licking river, with
six pieces of artillery. They carried this expedition so secretly,
that the unwary inhabitants did not discover them until they fired
upon the forts; and, not being prepared to oppose them, were obliged
to surrender themselves miserable captives to barbarous savages, who
immediately after tomahawked one man and two women, and loaded all the
others with heavy baggage, forcing them along toward their towns, able
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
or unable to march. Such as were weak and faint by the way, they
tomahawked. The tender women and helpless children fell victims to
their cruelty. This, and the savage treatment they received afterward,
is shocking to humanity, and too barbarous to relate.</p>

<p>The hostile disposition of the savages and their allies caused General
Clarke, the commandant at the Falls of the Ohio, immediately to begin
an expedition with his own regiment, and the armed force of the
country, against Pecaway, the principal town of the Shawanese, on a
branch of Great Miami, which he finished with great success, took
seventeen scalps, and burnt the town to ashes, with the loss of
seventeen men.</p>

<p>About this time I returned to Kentucky with my family; and here, to
avoid an inquiry into my conduct, the reader being before informed of
my bringing my family to Kentucky, I am under the necessity of
informing him that, during my captivity with the Indians, my wife, who
despaired of ever seeing me again&mdash;expecting the Indians had put a
period to my life, oppressed with the distresses of the country, and
bereaved of me, her only happiness&mdash;had, before I returned,
transported my family and goods, on horses, through the wilderness,
amid a multitude of dangers, to her father's house in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Shortly after the troubles at Boonesborough, I went to them, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
lived peaceably there until this time. The history of my going home,
and returning with my family, forms a series of difficulties, an
account of which would swell a volume; and, being foreign to my
purpose, I shall purposely omit them.</p>

<p>I settled my family in Boonesborough once more; and shortly after, on
the 6th day of October, 1780, I went in company with my brother to the
Blue Licks; and, on our return home, we were fired upon by a party of
Indians. They shot him, and pursued me, by the scent of their dog,
three miles; but I killed the dog, and escaped. The winter soon came
on, and was very severe, which confined the Indians to their wigwams.</p>

<p>The severity of this winter caused great difficulties in Kentucky. The
enemy had destroyed most of the corn the summer before. This necessary
article was scarce and dear, and the inhabitants lived chiefly on the
flesh of buffalo. The circumstances of many were very lamentable:
however, being a hardy race of people, and accustomed to difficulties
and necessities, they were wonderfully supported through all their
sufferings, until the ensuing autumn, when we received abundance from
the fertile soil.</p>

<p>Toward spring we were frequently harassed by Indians; and in May,
1782, a party assaulted Ashton's station, killed one man, and took a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
negro prisoner. Captain Ashton, with twenty-five men, pursued and
overtook the savages, and a smart fight ensued, which lasted two
hours; but they, being superior in number, obliged Captain Ashton's
party to retreat, with the loss of eight killed, and four mortally
wounded; their brave commander himself being numbered among the dead.</p>

<p>The Indians continued their hostilities; and, about the 10th of August
following, two boys were taken from Major Hoy's station. This party
was pursued by Captain Holder and seventeen men, who were also
defeated, with the loss of four men killed, and one wounded. Our
affairs became more and more alarming. Several stations which had
lately been erected in the country were continually infested with
savages, stealing their horses and killing the men at every
opportunity. In a field, near Lexington, an Indian shot a man, and
running to scalp him, was himself shot from the fort, and fell dead
upon his enemy.</p>

<p>Every day we experienced recent mischiefs. The barbarous savage
nations of Shawanese, Cherokees, Wyandots, Tawas, Delawares, and
several others near Detroit, united in a war against us, and assembled
their choicest warriors at Old Chilicothe, to go on the expedition, in
order to destroy us, and entirely depopulate the country. Their savage
minds were inflamed to mischief by two abandoned men, Captains M&#8216;Kee
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and Girty. These led them to execute every diabolical scheme, and on
the 15th day of August, commanded a party of Indians and Canadians, of
about five hundred in number, against Bryant's station, five miles
from Lexington. Without demanding a surrender, they furiously
assaulted the garrison, which was happily prepared to oppose them;
and, after they had expended much ammunition in vain, and killed the
cattle round the fort, not being likely to make themselves masters of
this place, they raised the siege, and departed in the morning of the
third day after they came, with the loss of about thirty killed, and
the number of wounded uncertain. Of the garrison, four were killed,
and three wounded.</p>

<p>On the 18th day, Colonel Todd, Colonel Trigg, Major Harland, and
myself, speedily collected one hundred and seventy-six men, well
armed, and pursued the savages. They had marched beyond the Blue
Licks, to a remarkable bend of the main fork of Licking river, about
forty-three miles from Lexington, where we overtook them on the 19th
day. The savages observing us, gave way; and we, being ignorant of
their numbers, passed the river. When the enemy saw our proceedings,
having greatly the advantage of us in situation, they formed the line
of battle, from one bend of Licking to the other, about a mile from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the Blue Licks. An exceeding fierce battle immediately began, for
about fifteen minutes, when we, being overpowered by numbers, were
obliged to retreat, with the loss of sixty-seven men, seven of whom
were taken prisoners. The brave and much-lamented Colonels Todd and
Trigg, Major Harland, and my second son, were among the dead. We were
informed that the Indians, numbering their dead, found they had four
killed more than we; and therefore four of the prisoners they had
taken were, by general consent, ordered to be killed in a most
barbarous manner by the young warriors, in order to train them up to
cruelty; and then they proceeded to their towns.</p>

<p>On our retreat we were met by Colonel Logan, hastening to join us,
with a number of well-armed men. This powerful assistance we
unfortunately wanted in the battle; for, notwithstanding the enemy's
superiority of numbers, they acknowledged, that, if they had received
one more fire from us, they should undoubtedly have given way. So
valiantly did our small party fight, that, to the memory of those who
unfortunately fell in the battle, enough of honor can not be paid. Had
Colonel Logan and his party been with us, it is highly probable we
should have given the savages a total defeat.</p>

<p>I can not reflect upon this dreadful scene, but sorrow fills my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
heart. A zeal for the defence of their country led these heroes to the
scene of action, though with a few men to attack a powerful army of
experienced warriors. When we gave way, they pursued us with the
utmost eagerness, and in every quarter spread destruction. The river
was difficult to cross, and many were killed in the flight&mdash;some just
entering the river, some in the water, others after crossing, in
ascending the cliffs. Some escaped on horseback, a few on foot; and,
being dispersed everywhere in a few hours, brought the melancholy news
of this unfortunate battle to Lexington. Many widows were now made.
The reader may guess what sorrow filled the hearts of the inhabitants,
exceeding anything that I am able to describe. Being reinforced, we
returned to bury the dead, and found their bodies strewed everywhere,
cut and mangled in a dreadful manner. This mournful scene exhibited a
horror almost unparalleled: some torn and eaten by wild beasts; those
in the river eaten by fishes; all in such a putrefied condition, that
no one could be distinguished from another.</p>

<p>As soon as General Clarke, then at the Falls of the Ohio&mdash;who was
ever our ready friend, and merits the love and gratitude of all his
countrymen&mdash;understood the circumstances of this unfortunate action,
he ordered an expedition, with all possible haste, to pursue the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
savages, which was so expeditiously effected, that we overtook them
within two miles of their towns: and probably might have obtained a
great victory, had not two of their number met us about two hundred
poles before we came up. These returned quick as lightning to their
camp, with the alarming news of a mighty army in view. The savages
fled in the utmost disorder, evacuated their towns, and reluctantly
left their territory to our mercy. We immediately took possession of
Old Chilicothe without opposition, being deserted by its inhabitants.
We continued our pursuit through five towns on the Miami rivers,
Old Chilicothe, Pecaway, New Chilicothe, Will's Towns, and
Chilicothe&mdash;burnt them all to ashes, entirely destroyed their corn,
and other fruits, and everywhere spread a scene of desolation in the
country. In this expedition we took seven prisoners and five scalps,
with the loss of only four men, two of whom were accidentally killed
by our own army.</p>

<p>This campaign in some measure damped the spirits of the Indians, and
made them sensible of our superiority. Their connexions were
dissolved, their armies scattered, and a future invasion put entirely
out of their power; yet they continued to practise mischief secretly
upon the inhabitants, in the exposed parts of the country.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
</p>

<p>In October following, a party made an excursion into that district
called the Crab Orchard; and one of them, being advanced some distance
before the others, boldly entered the house of a poor defenceless
family, in which was only a negro man, a woman, and her children,
terrified with the apprehensions of immediate death. The savage,
perceiving their defenceless situation, without offering violence to
the family, attempted to capture the negro, who happily proved an
overmatch for him, threw him on the ground, and, in the struggle, the
mother of the children drew an axe from a corner of the cottage, and
cut his head off, while her little daughter shut the door. The savages
instantly appeared, and applied their tomahawks to the door. An old
rusty gun-barrel, without a lock, lay in a corner, which the mother
put through a small crevice, and the savages, perceiving it, fled. In
the mean time, the alarm spread through the neighborhood; the armed
men collected immediately, and pursued the ravagers into the
wilderness. Thus Providence, by the means of this negro, saved the
whole of the poor family from destruction. From that time until the
happy return of peace between the United States and Great Britain, the
Indians did us no mischief. Finding the great king beyond the water
disappointed in his expectations, and conscious of the importance of
the Long Knife, and their own wretchedness, some of the nations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
immediately desired peace; to which, at present [1784], they seem
universally disposed, and are sending ambassadors to General Clarke,
at the Falls of the Ohio, with the minutes of their councils.</p>

<p>To conclude, I can now say that I have verified the saying of an old
Indian who signed Colonel Henderson's deed. Taking me by the hand, at
the delivery thereof&mdash;"Brother," said he, "we have given you a fine
land, but I believe you will have much trouble in settling it." My
footsteps have often been marked with blood, and therefore I can truly
subscribe to its original name. Two darling sons and a brother have I
lost by savage hands, which have also taken from me forty valuable
horses, and abundance of cattle. Many dark and sleepless nights have I
been a companion for owls, separated from the cheerful society of men,
scorched by the summer's sun, and pinched by the winter's cold&mdash;an
instrument ordained to settle the wilderness. But now the scene is
changed: peace crowns the sylvan shade.</p>

<p>What thanks, what ardent and ceaseless thanks are due to that
all-superintending Providence which has turned a cruel war into peace,
brought order out of confusion, made the fierce savages placid, and
turned away their hostile weapons from our country! May the same
Almighty Goodness banish the accursed monster, war, from all lands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
with her hated associates, rapine and insatiable ambition! Let peace,
descending from her native heaven, bid her olives spring amid the
joyful nations; and plenty, in league with commerce, scatter blessings
from her copious hand!</p>

<p>This account of my adventures will inform the reader of the most
remarkable events of this country. I now live in peace and safety,
enjoying the sweets of liberty, and the bounties of Providence, with
my once fellow-sufferers, in this delightful country, which I have
seen purchased with a vast expense of blood and treasure: delighting
in the prospect of its being, in a short time, one of the most opulent
and powerful states on the continent of North America; which, with the
love and gratitude of my countrymen, I esteem a sufficient reward for
all my toil and dangers.</p>
